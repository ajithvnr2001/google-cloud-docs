## Code sample

### Python

Before trying this sample, follow the Python setup instructions in the [Vertex AI quickstart using client libraries](https://docs.cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/docs/start/client-libraries). For more information, see the [Vertex AI Python API reference documentation](https://docs.cloud.google.com/python/docs/reference/aiplatform/latest). 

To authenticate to Vertex AI, set up Application Default Credentials. For more information, see [Set up authentication for a local development environment](https://docs.cloud.google.com/docs/authentication/set-up-adc-local-dev-environment). 
    
    
    import [vertexai](https://docs.cloud.google.com/python/docs/reference/agentplatform/latest)
    from vertexai.preview import extensions
    
    # TODO (developer):Update project_id
    # PROJECT_ID = "your-project-id"
    [vertexai](https://docs.cloud.google.com/python/docs/reference/agentplatform/latest).init(project=PROJECT_ID, location="us-central1")
    
    extensions_list = extensions.Extension.list()
    print(extensions_list)
    # Example response:
    # [<vertexai.extensions._extensions.Extension object at 0x76e8ced37af0>
    # resource name: projects/[PROJECT_ID]/locations/us-central1/extensions/1234567890123456]
