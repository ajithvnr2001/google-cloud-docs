    public interface MinuteRangeOrBuilder extends MessageOrBuilder

## Implements

[MessageOrBuilder](https://cloud.google.com/java/docs/reference/protobuf/latest/com.google.protobuf.MessageOrBuilder.html)

## Methods 

### getEndMinutesAgo()
    
    
    public abstract int getEndMinutesAgo()

The inclusive end minute for the query as a number of minutes before now. Cannot be before `startMinutesAgo`. For example, `"endMinutesAgo": 15` specifies the report should include event data from prior to 15 minutes ago.

If unspecified, `endMinutesAgo` is defaulted to 0. Standard Analytics properties can request any minute in the last 30 minutes of event data (`endMinutesAgo <= 29`), and 360 Analytics properties can request any minute in the last 60 minutes of event data (`endMinutesAgo <= 59`).

`optional int32 end_minutes_ago = 2;`

**Returns**  
---  
**Type** | **Description**  
`[int](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/nutsandbolts/datatypes.html)` | The endMinutesAgo.  
  
### getName()
    
    
    public abstract String getName()

Assigns a name to this minute range. The dimension `dateRange` is valued to this name in a report response. If set, cannot begin with `date_range_` or `RESERVED_`. If not set, minute ranges are named by their zero based index in the request: `date_range_0`, `date_range_1`, etc.

`string name = 3;`

**Returns**  
---  
**Type** | **Description**  
`[String](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/lang/String.html)` | The name.  
  
### getNameBytes()
    
    
    public abstract ByteString getNameBytes()

Assigns a name to this minute range. The dimension `dateRange` is valued to this name in a report response. If set, cannot begin with `date_range_` or `RESERVED_`. If not set, minute ranges are named by their zero based index in the request: `date_range_0`, `date_range_1`, etc.

`string name = 3;`

**Returns**  
---  
**Type** | **Description**  
`[ByteString](https://cloud.google.com/java/docs/reference/protobuf/latest/com.google.protobuf.ByteString.html)` | The bytes for name.  
  
### getStartMinutesAgo()
    
    
    public abstract int getStartMinutesAgo()

The inclusive start minute for the query as a number of minutes before now. For example, `"startMinutesAgo": 29` specifies the report should include event data from 29 minutes ago and after. Cannot be after `endMinutesAgo`.

If unspecified, `startMinutesAgo` is defaulted to 29. Standard Analytics properties can request up to the last 30 minutes of event data (`startMinutesAgo <= 29`), and 360 Analytics properties can request up to the last 60 minutes of event data (`startMinutesAgo <= 59`).

`optional int32 start_minutes_ago = 1;`

**Returns**  
---  
**Type** | **Description**  
`[int](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/nutsandbolts/datatypes.html)` | The startMinutesAgo.  
  
### hasEndMinutesAgo()
    
    
    public abstract boolean hasEndMinutesAgo()

The inclusive end minute for the query as a number of minutes before now. Cannot be before `startMinutesAgo`. For example, `"endMinutesAgo": 15` specifies the report should include event data from prior to 15 minutes ago.

If unspecified, `endMinutesAgo` is defaulted to 0. Standard Analytics properties can request any minute in the last 30 minutes of event data (`endMinutesAgo <= 29`), and 360 Analytics properties can request any minute in the last 60 minutes of event data (`endMinutesAgo <= 59`).

`optional int32 end_minutes_ago = 2;`

**Returns**  
---  
**Type** | **Description**  
`[boolean](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/nutsandbolts/datatypes.html)` | Whether the endMinutesAgo field is set.  
  
### hasStartMinutesAgo()
    
    
    public abstract boolean hasStartMinutesAgo()

The inclusive start minute for the query as a number of minutes before now. For example, `"startMinutesAgo": 29` specifies the report should include event data from 29 minutes ago and after. Cannot be after `endMinutesAgo`.

If unspecified, `startMinutesAgo` is defaulted to 29. Standard Analytics properties can request up to the last 30 minutes of event data (`startMinutesAgo <= 29`), and 360 Analytics properties can request up to the last 60 minutes of event data (`startMinutesAgo <= 59`).

`optional int32 start_minutes_ago = 1;`

**Returns**  
---  
**Type** | **Description**  
`[boolean](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/nutsandbolts/datatypes.html)` | Whether the startMinutesAgo field is set.
