    public interface DeleteTenantRequestOrBuilder extends MessageOrBuilder

## Implements

[MessageOrBuilder](https://cloud.google.com/java/docs/reference/protobuf/latest/com.google.protobuf.MessageOrBuilder.html)

## Methods 

### getEtag()
    
    
    public abstract String getEtag()

The etag known to the client for the expected state of the tenant. This is used with state-changing methods to prevent accidental overwrites when multiple user agents might be acting in parallel on the same resource.

An etag wildcard provide optimistic concurrency based on the expected existence of the tenant. The Any wildcard (`__`) requires that the resource must already exists, and the Not Any wildcard (`!`) requires that it must not.

`string etag = 10202;`

**Returns**  
---  
**Type** | **Description**  
`[String](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/lang/String.html)` | The etag.  
  
### getEtagBytes()
    
    
    public abstract ByteString getEtagBytes()

The etag known to the client for the expected state of the tenant. This is used with state-changing methods to prevent accidental overwrites when multiple user agents might be acting in parallel on the same resource.

An etag wildcard provide optimistic concurrency based on the expected existence of the tenant. The Any wildcard (`__`) requires that the resource must already exists, and the Not Any wildcard (`!`) requires that it must not.

`string etag = 10202;`

**Returns**  
---  
**Type** | **Description**  
`[ByteString](https://cloud.google.com/java/docs/reference/protobuf/latest/com.google.protobuf.ByteString.html)` | The bytes for etag.  
  
### getName()
    
    
    public abstract String getName()

Required. The resource name of the resource within a service.

` string name = 10001 [(.google.api.field_behavior) = REQUIRED, (.google.api.resource_reference) = { ... } `

**Returns**  
---  
**Type** | **Description**  
`[String](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/lang/String.html)` | The name.  
  
### getNameBytes()
    
    
    public abstract ByteString getNameBytes()

Required. The resource name of the resource within a service.

` string name = 10001 [(.google.api.field_behavior) = REQUIRED, (.google.api.resource_reference) = { ... } `

**Returns**  
---  
**Type** | **Description**  
`[ByteString](https://cloud.google.com/java/docs/reference/protobuf/latest/com.google.protobuf.ByteString.html)` | The bytes for name.  
  
### getRequestId()
    
    
    public abstract String getRequestId()

An optional request ID to identify requests. Specify a unique request ID so that if you must retry your request, the server will know to ignore the request if it has already been completed. The server will guarantee that for at least 60 minutes since the first request.

For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and the request times out. If you make the request again with the same request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments.

The request ID must be a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID is not supported (00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000).

`string request_id = 10502;`

**Returns**  
---  
**Type** | **Description**  
`[String](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/lang/String.html)` | The requestId.  
  
### getRequestIdBytes()
    
    
    public abstract ByteString getRequestIdBytes()

An optional request ID to identify requests. Specify a unique request ID so that if you must retry your request, the server will know to ignore the request if it has already been completed. The server will guarantee that for at least 60 minutes since the first request.

`string request_id = 10502;`

**Returns**  
---  
**Type** | **Description**  
`[ByteString](https://cloud.google.com/java/docs/reference/protobuf/latest/com.google.protobuf.ByteString.html)` | The bytes for requestId.  
  
### getValidateOnly()
    
    
    public abstract boolean getValidateOnly()

If "validate_only" is set to true, the service will try to validate that this request would succeed, but will not actually make changes.

`bool validate_only = 10501;`

**Returns**  
---  
**Type** | **Description**  
`[boolean](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/nutsandbolts/datatypes.html)` | The validateOnly.
