    public interface RetryConfigOrBuilder extends MessageOrBuilder

## Implements

[MessageOrBuilder](https://cloud.google.com/java/docs/reference/protobuf/latest/com.google.protobuf.MessageOrBuilder.html)

## Methods 

### getMaxBackoffDuration()
    
    
    public abstract Duration getMaxBackoffDuration()

The maximum amount of time to wait before retrying a job after it fails. The default value of this field is 1 hour.

`.google.protobuf.Duration max_backoff_duration = 4;`

**Returns**  
---  
**Type** | **Description**  
`[Duration](https://cloud.google.com/java/docs/reference/protobuf/latest/com.google.protobuf.Duration.html)` | The maxBackoffDuration.  
  
### getMaxBackoffDurationOrBuilder()
    
    
    public abstract DurationOrBuilder getMaxBackoffDurationOrBuilder()

The maximum amount of time to wait before retrying a job after it fails. The default value of this field is 1 hour.

`.google.protobuf.Duration max_backoff_duration = 4;`

**Returns**  
---  
**Type** | **Description**  
`[DurationOrBuilder](https://cloud.google.com/java/docs/reference/protobuf/latest/com.google.protobuf.DurationOrBuilder.html)` |   
  
### getMaxDoublings()
    
    
    public abstract int getMaxDoublings()

The time between retries will double `max_doublings` times. A job's retry interval starts at min_backoff_duration, then doubles `max_doublings` times, then increases linearly, and finally retries at intervals of max_backoff_duration up to retry_count times. For example, if min_backoff_duration is 10s, max_backoff_duration is 300s, and `max_doublings` is 3, then the job will first be retried in 10s. The retry interval will double three times, and then increase linearly by 2^3 * 10s. Finally, the job will retry at intervals of max_backoff_duration until the job has been attempted retry_count times. Thus, the requests will retry at 10s, 20s, 40s, 80s, 160s, 240s, 300s, 300s, .... The default value of this field is 5.

`int32 max_doublings = 5;`

**Returns**  
---  
**Type** | **Description**  
`[int](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/nutsandbolts/datatypes.html)` | The maxDoublings.  
  
### getMaxRetryDuration()
    
    
    public abstract Duration getMaxRetryDuration()

The time limit for retrying a failed job, measured from time when an execution was first attempted. If specified with retry_count, the job will be retried until both limits are reached. The default value for max_retry_duration is zero, which means retry duration is unlimited.

`.google.protobuf.Duration max_retry_duration = 2;`

**Returns**  
---  
**Type** | **Description**  
`[Duration](https://cloud.google.com/java/docs/reference/protobuf/latest/com.google.protobuf.Duration.html)` | The maxRetryDuration.  
  
### getMaxRetryDurationOrBuilder()
    
    
    public abstract DurationOrBuilder getMaxRetryDurationOrBuilder()

The time limit for retrying a failed job, measured from time when an execution was first attempted. If specified with retry_count, the job will be retried until both limits are reached. The default value for max_retry_duration is zero, which means retry duration is unlimited.

`.google.protobuf.Duration max_retry_duration = 2;`

**Returns**  
---  
**Type** | **Description**  
`[DurationOrBuilder](https://cloud.google.com/java/docs/reference/protobuf/latest/com.google.protobuf.DurationOrBuilder.html)` |   
  
### getMinBackoffDuration()
    
    
    public abstract Duration getMinBackoffDuration()

The minimum amount of time to wait before retrying a job after it fails. The default value of this field is 5 seconds.

`.google.protobuf.Duration min_backoff_duration = 3;`

**Returns**  
---  
**Type** | **Description**  
`[Duration](https://cloud.google.com/java/docs/reference/protobuf/latest/com.google.protobuf.Duration.html)` | The minBackoffDuration.  
  
### getMinBackoffDurationOrBuilder()
    
    
    public abstract DurationOrBuilder getMinBackoffDurationOrBuilder()

The minimum amount of time to wait before retrying a job after it fails. The default value of this field is 5 seconds.

`.google.protobuf.Duration min_backoff_duration = 3;`

**Returns**  
---  
**Type** | **Description**  
`[DurationOrBuilder](https://cloud.google.com/java/docs/reference/protobuf/latest/com.google.protobuf.DurationOrBuilder.html)` |   
  
### getRetryCount()
    
    
    public abstract int getRetryCount()

The number of attempts that the system will make to run a job using the exponential backoff procedure described by max_doublings. The default value of retry_count is zero. If retry_count is 0, a job attempt will not be retried if it fails. Instead the Cloud Scheduler system will wait for the next scheduled execution time. Setting retry_count to 0 does not prevent failed jobs from running according to schedule after the failure. If retry_count is set to a non-zero number then Cloud Scheduler will retry failed attempts, using exponential backoff, retry_count times, or until the next scheduled execution time, whichever comes first. Values greater than 5 and negative values are not allowed.

`int32 retry_count = 1;`

**Returns**  
---  
**Type** | **Description**  
`[int](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/nutsandbolts/datatypes.html)` | The retryCount.  
  
### hasMaxBackoffDuration()
    
    
    public abstract boolean hasMaxBackoffDuration()

The maximum amount of time to wait before retrying a job after it fails. The default value of this field is 1 hour.

`.google.protobuf.Duration max_backoff_duration = 4;`

**Returns**  
---  
**Type** | **Description**  
`[boolean](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/nutsandbolts/datatypes.html)` | Whether the maxBackoffDuration field is set.  
  
### hasMaxRetryDuration()
    
    
    public abstract boolean hasMaxRetryDuration()

The time limit for retrying a failed job, measured from time when an execution was first attempted. If specified with retry_count, the job will be retried until both limits are reached. The default value for max_retry_duration is zero, which means retry duration is unlimited.

`.google.protobuf.Duration max_retry_duration = 2;`

**Returns**  
---  
**Type** | **Description**  
`[boolean](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/nutsandbolts/datatypes.html)` | Whether the maxRetryDuration field is set.  
  
### hasMinBackoffDuration()
    
    
    public abstract boolean hasMinBackoffDuration()

The minimum amount of time to wait before retrying a job after it fails. The default value of this field is 5 seconds.

`.google.protobuf.Duration min_backoff_duration = 3;`

**Returns**  
---  
**Type** | **Description**  
`[boolean](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/nutsandbolts/datatypes.html)` | Whether the minBackoffDuration field is set.
