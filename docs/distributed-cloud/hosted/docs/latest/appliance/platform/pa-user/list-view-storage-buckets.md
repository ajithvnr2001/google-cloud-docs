#  View and list storage bucket configurations Stay organized with collections  Save and categorize content based on your preferences. 

This page guides you through how to list storage buckets within a Google Distributed Cloud (GDC) air-gapped appliance project and view the configuration details for each bucket. Learn about the prerequisites and the steps using both the GDC console and command line interface (CLI). This information lets you gain full visibility of your object storage resources and helps you verify their configuration.

This page is for audiences such as IT admins within the infrastructure operator group or developers within the application operator group who are responsible for managing object storage resources in GDC air-gapped environments.

## Before you begin

A project namespace manages bucket resources in the management API server. You must have a [project](https://docs.cloud.google.com/distributed-cloud/hosted/docs/latest/appliance/platform/pa-user/create-a-project) to work with buckets and objects.

You must also have the appropriate bucket permissions to perform the following operation. See [Grant bucket access](https://docs.cloud.google.com/distributed-cloud/hosted/docs/latest/appliance/platform/pa-user/grant-obtain-storage-access#grant_bucket_access).

To run commands against the management API server, [sign in and generate](https://docs.cloud.google.com/distributed-cloud/hosted/docs/latest/appliance/platform/pa-user/iam/sign-in#management-api-kubeconfig) the kubeconfig file for the management API server if you don't have one.

## List storage buckets

To list all the buckets that you have access to in a given object storage tenant, complete the following steps:

  1. Run the following commands to list all buckets:
         
         kubectl get buckets --all-namespaces
         kubectl get buckets --namespace NAMESPACE_NAME
         




### View bucket configuration

Use either command to view the configuration details for a bucket:
    
    
        kubectl describe buckets/BUCKET_NAME --namespace NAMESPACE_NAME
    
    
    
        kubectl get buckets/BUCKET_NAME --namespace NAMESPACE_NAME -o yaml
