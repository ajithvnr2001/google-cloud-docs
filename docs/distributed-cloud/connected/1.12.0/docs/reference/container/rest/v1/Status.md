#  Status Stay organized with collections  Save and categorize content based on your preferences.

The `Status` type defines a logical error model that is suitable for different programming environments, including REST APIs and RPC APIs. It is used by [gRPC](https://github.com/grpc). Each `Status` message contains three pieces of data: error code, error message, and error details.

You can find out more about this error model and how to work with it in the [API Design Guide](https://cloud.google.com/apis/design/errors).

`code` |  `integer` The status code, which should be an enum value of `google.rpc.Code`.  
`message` |  `string` A developer-facing error message, which should be in English. Any user-facing error message should be localized and sent in the `[google.rpc.Status.details](https://docs.cloud.google.com/distributed-cloud/connected/1.12.0/docs/reference/container/rest/v1/Status#FIELDS.details)` field, or localized by the client.  
`details[]` |  `object` A list of messages that carry the error details. There is a common set of message types for APIs to use.An object containing fields of an arbitrary type. An additional field `"@type"` contains a URI identifying the type. Example: `{ "id": 1234, "@type": "types.example.com/standard/id" }`.
