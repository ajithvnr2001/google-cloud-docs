Starts asynchronous cancellation on a long-running operation. The server makes a best effort to cancel the operation, but success is not guaranteed. If the server doesn't support this method, it returns `google.rpc.Code.UNIMPLEMENTED`. Clients can use `[Operations.GetOperation](https://docs.cloud.google.com/memorystore/docs/cluster/reference/rest/v1alpha1/projects.locations.operations/get#google.longrunning.Operations.GetOperation)` or other methods to check whether the cancellation succeeded or whether the operation completed despite cancellation. On successful cancellation, the operation is not deleted; instead, it becomes an operation with an `[Operation.error](https://docs.cloud.google.com/memorystore/docs/cluster/reference/rest/Shared.Types/ListOperationsResponse#Operation.FIELDS.error)` value with a `[google.rpc.Status.code](https://docs.cloud.google.com/memorystore/docs/cluster/reference/rest/Shared.Types/ListOperationsResponse#Status.FIELDS.code)` of `1`, corresponding to `Code.CANCELLED`.

### HTTP request
