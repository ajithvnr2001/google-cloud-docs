Fields  
---  
`name` |  `string` The name of the operation's parent resource.  
`filter` |  `string` The standard list filter.  
`pageSize` |  `integer` The standard list page size.  
`pageToken` |  `string` The standard list page token.  
`returnPartialSuccess` |  `boolean` When set to `true`, operations that are reachable are returned as normal, and those that are unreachable are returned in the `[ListOperationsResponse.unreachable](https://docs.cloud.google.com/memorystore/docs/cluster/reference/rest/Shared.Types/ListOperationsResponse#FIELDS.unreachable)` field.This can only be `true` when reading across collections. For example, when `parent` is set to `"projects/example/locations/-"`.This field is not supported by default and will result in an `UNIMPLEMENTED` error if set unless explicitly documented otherwise in service or product specific documentation.
