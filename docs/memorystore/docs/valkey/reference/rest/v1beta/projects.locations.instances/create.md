`POST https://memorystore.googleapis.com/v1beta/{parent=projects/*/locations/*}/instances`

The URLs use [gRPC Transcoding](https://google.aip.dev/127) syntax.

### Path parameters

Parameters  
---  
`parent` |  `string` Required. The parent resource where this instance will be created. Format: projects/{project}/locations/{location}  
  
### Query parameters

Parameters  
---  
`instanceId` |  `string` Required. The ID to use for the instance, which will become the final component of the instance's resource name.This value is subject to the following restrictions:

  * Must be 4-63 characters in length
  * Must begin with a letter or digit
  * Must contain only lowercase letters, digits, and hyphens
  * Must not end with a hyphen
  * Must be unique within a location

  
`requestId` |  `string` Optional. An optional request ID to identify requests. Specify a unique request ID so that if you must retry your request, the server will know to ignore the request if it has already been completed. The server will guarantee that for at least 60 minutes since the first request.For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and the request times out. If you make the request again with the same request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments.The request ID must be a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID is not supported (00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000).

### Authorization scopes

  * `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/cloud-platform`
  * `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/memorystore.read-write`



### IAM Permissions
