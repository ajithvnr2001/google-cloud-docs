# Create and manage tables

Bigtable tables let you organize and store large-scale data for low-latency application workloads. You can create and manage these tables using the Google Cloud console, the Google Cloud CLI, the `cbt` CLI , or programmatically with the Cloud Bigtable [client libraries](https://docs.cloud.google.com/bigtable/docs/reference/libraries).

For more information about creating and managing authorized views of a table, see [authorized views](https://docs.cloud.google.com/bigtable/docs/control-access-with-authorized-views).

## Before you begin

If you plan to work with your tables using command-line tools, follow the steps in this section.

  1. Install the [gcloud CLI](https://docs.cloud.google.com/bigtable/docs/installing-cloud-sdk).

  2. Optional: If you plan to use the `cbt` CLI , follow the instructions at [Installing the `cbt` CLI ](https://docs.cloud.google.com/bigtable/docs/cbt-overview#installing), including the step to create a `.cbtrc` file.

The `cbt` CLI instructions on this page assume that you have set the project ID and instance ID in your `.cbtrc` file. Alternatively, you can use the `-project` and `-instance` flags to set these values each time you run a `cbt` CLI command.




## Create a table

When you create a table, you don't need to specify the column families to use in the table. You can add or delete column families later.

###  Console 

To create a new table in an instance:

  1. In the Google Cloud console, open the list of Bigtable instances. 

[ Open the instance list ](https://console.cloud.google.com/bigtable/instances)

  2. Click the instance whose tables you want to view.

  3. Click **Tables** in the left pane.

The **Tables** page displays a list of tables in the instance.

  4. Click add_box **Create table**.

  5. Enter a table ID for the table.

  6. Optional: Add column families.

You can add columns now or later. A table must have at least one column family before you can write data to it or read a change stream from it.

  7. Optional: Enable a change stream for the table. Before you enable a change stream, make sure that you understand the implications, including increased storage costs and app profile usage requirements. To review these details, see the [Overview of change streams](https://docs.cloud.google.com/bigtable/docs/change-streams-overview).

     1. Select **Enable change stream**.

     2. In the **Retention time** field, enter a number from 1 to 7 to specify the number of days that the change stream data should be retained.

  8. Optional: If you don't want Bigtable to create a daily backup of the table, clear the **Enable automated backup** checkbox. For more information, see [Use automated backup](https://docs.cloud.google.com/bigtable/docs/managing-backups#use-automated-backup).

  9. Optional: Enable infrequent access for the table as part of [tiered storage](https://docs.cloud.google.com/bigtable/docs/tiered-storage) ([Preview](https://cloud.google.com/products#product-launch-stages)):

     1. Select **Enable tiered storage**.

     2. In the **Age threshold** field, enter the number of days after which Bigtable moves data from SSD storage to infrequent access storage. The number must be 30 or greater.

  10. Optional, **Enterprise Plus edition** : By default, a daily backup is created in all clusters in the table's instance. To choose clusters where Bigtable must create a daily backup of the table, select cluster locations in the **Select clusters to back up** field. For more information, see [Configure automated backup cluster locations](https://docs.cloud.google.com/bigtable/docs/managing-backups#automated-backup-cluster-locations).

  11. Optional: To configure row key schema, select **Define row key schema** , and then do the following:

     1. In the **Encoding** list, select a type of encoding for your row key schema.

     2. If you selected **DelimitedBytes** , in the **Delimiter** field, enter a delimiter that separates the segments in your existing row keys. The default value is a hash symbol (`#`).

     3. In the **Segment** field, enter a name for the segment, such as `device_type`.

     4. In the **Type** list, select the data type of the row key segment.

     5. Depending on the data type selected, in the **Byte encoding** list, leave the default encoding type of the row key segment or change it.

     6. Optional: if your row key segment has more than one part, click **Add row key segment** to add additional fields.

  12. Click **Create**.




###  gcloud 

To create a table, run the following command. See [`gcloud bigtable instances tables create`](https://docs.cloud.google.com/sdk/gcloud/reference/bigtable/instances/tables/create) for a complete list of options.
    
    
    gcloud bigtable instances tables create TABLE_ID \
        --instance=INSTANCE_ID \
        --project=PROJECT_ID \
        --column-families=COLUMN-FAMILIES
    

Replace the following:

  * TABLE_ID: a unique ID for the new table
  * INSTANCE_ID: the ID of the instance
  * PROJECT_ID: the project that will contain the new table
  * COLUMN-FAMILIES: a comma-separated list of column family names. You can add more column families later.



Optional:

  * To protect the table from deletion, append the command with `--deletion-protection`. If you don't apply this setting, the table can be deleted. You can also explicitly allow table deletion by appending `--no-deletion-protection`.

  * To enable a change stream for the table, specify a retention period for the change stream data. Before you enable a change stream, make sure that you understand the implications, including increased storage costs and app profile usage requirements. To review these details, see the [Overview of change streams](https://docs.cloud.google.com/bigtable/docs/change-streams-overview).
        
        --change-stream-retention-period=RETENTION_PERIOD
        

Replace RETENTION_PERIOD with the length of time that Bigtable should retain change stream data for the table. The time must be from one to seven days. Acceptable units are days (d), hours (h), minutes (m), and seconds (s). Examples: `48h` or `6d`

  * To let Bigtable create a daily backup of your table and retain each backup for the default retention period of seven days, use the `--enable-automated-backup` flag when you create your table.
        
        gcloud bigtable instances tables create TABLE_ID \
            --instance=INSTANCE_ID \
            --project=PROJECT_ID \
            --column-families=COLUMN-FAMILIES \
            --enable-automated-backup
        

To configure a different retention period, use the `--automated-backup-retention-period` flag instead of the `--enable-automated-backup` flag and provide a value up to 90 days. The value must be expressed as a number with a unit of `m`, `h`, or `d` (minutes, hours, or days), such as `15d` for 15 days.

**Enterprise Plus edition** : By default, a daily backup is created in all clusters in the table's instance. To configure cluster locations where Bigtable must create a daily backup of the table, use the `--automated-backup-locations` flag instead of the `--enable-automated-backup` flag. Provide a comma-separated list of cluster locations where the automated backup must be enabled. Example: `us-central1-a,us-east1-b,europe-west1-c`.

**Note:** If both a custom retention period and automated backup locations are configured for your table, make sure to **use both flags** to modify the table's configuration later, even if you change only one of the parameters. Otherwise, the other parameter will **reset to the default value**.
  * To enable infrequent access as part of [tiered storage](https://docs.cloud.google.com/bigtable/docs/tiered-storage) ([Preview](https://cloud.google.com/products#product-launch-stages)), use the   
`--tiered-storage-infrequent-access-older-than` flag and replace AGE_THRESHOLD with a value of at least 30 days. Acceptable units are days (`d`), hours (`h`), minutes (`m`), and seconds (`s`). Example: `32d` or `32d12h`.
        
        gcloud beta bigtable instances tables create TABLE_ID \
            --instance=INSTANCE_ID \
            --project=PROJECT_ID \
            --tiered-storage-infrequent-access-older-than=AGE_THRESHOLD
        




###  cbt 

Use the following command, replacing `TABLE_NAME` with the name of your table. You can't use the `cbt` CLI to create a table with a change stream enabled.
    
    
    cbt createtable TABLE_ID
    

Optional: To create an [aggregate column family](https://docs.cloud.google.com/bigtable/docs/aggregates#aggregate-column-families) in the table, append the column family name with the aggregation type. The following creates an aggregate column family with a garbage collection policy of `never`.
    
    
    cbt createtable TABLE_ID families=FAMILY_NAME:never:TYPE
    

Replace the following:

  * TABLE_ID: a unique ID for the new table
  * FAMILY_NAME: : a comma-separated list of column family names. You can add more column families later.
  * TYPE: the aggregate type. Must be `intsum`, `intmin`, `intmax`, or `inthll`.



For more options, see [Create a table](https://docs.cloud.google.com/bigtable/docs/cbt-reference#create_a_table) in the `cbt` CLI reference.

If you have mistakenly deleted a table, don't attempt to manually create the deleted table. Use the gcloud CLI command [`bigtable instances tables undelete`](https://docs.cloud.google.com/sdk/gcloud/reference/bigtable/instances/tables/undelete) to recover the table.

### Optional: Split the table by row key

**Key Point:** You can specify table splits only when creating a new table, and those specified splits remain for about 24 hours.

To optimize performance, Bigtable continuously splits tables across multiple nodes, evenly distributing the amount of data stored on each node, and keeping frequently accessed rows spread apart where possible. This ongoing process is automatic.

When you create a new table, you can specify initial table splits. Bigtable splits the table at the row keys that you provide. If the key spaces are too big, Bigtable further splits the table. The initial splits are maintained for about 24 hours after the table creation is complete. You can provide up to 100 row keys where the initial splits should occur.

For example, you might designate specific rows to pre-split your table if you're about to write many rows to the table.

Pre-splitting your table is not essential, but it is beneficial because it provides Bigtable information about where the load and data footprint are likely to land when the table is created. The pre-split prevents Bigtable from having to split the tables and rebalance the load all at once as the data arrives.

###  Console 

You are not able to pre-split the rows when you create a table using the Google Cloud console.

###  gcloud 

To split a table by row key, run the following command. See [`gcloud bigtable instances tables create`](https://docs.cloud.google.com/sdk/gcloud/reference/bigtable/instances/tables/create) for a complete list of options.
    
    
    gcloud bigtable instances tables create TABLE_ID\
        --instance=INSTANCE_ID \
        --project=PROJECT_ID \
        --column-families=COLUMN-FAMILIES \
        --splits=SPLITS
    

Replace the following:

  * TABLE_ID: a unique ID for the new table
  * INSTANCE_ID: the ID of the instance
  * PROJECT_ID: the project that will contain the new table
  * COLUMN-FAMILIES: a comma-separated list of column family names. You can add more column families later.
  * SPLITS: the row keys where the table should initially be split—for example, `10,20`.



###  cbt 

To pre-split a table based on the row key, use the following syntax to create the table. Replace `[TABLE_NAME]` with the table name and `[SPLITS]` with a comma-separated list of row-key prefixes to use for the pre-splits.
    
    
    ```none
    cbt createtable [TABLE_NAME] splits=[SPLITS]
    ```
    

For example, to pre-split the table `my-table` at row keys that begin with `10` and `20`:
    
    
    ```none
    cbt createtable my-table splits=10,20
    ```
    

## Modify column families in a table

You can add column families when you create a table or to an existing table. If the table doesn't have deletion protection enabled, then you can delete column families in the table.

### Add column families

###  Console 

#### Add column families to a new table

  1. In the **Create table** pane, for each column family that you want to add, click **Add a column family**.

  2. In the **Column family name** field, enter a unique identifier for the column family.

  3. Choose the column family type:

     * **Standard** : creates a standard column family that is managed by garbage collection policies.
     * **Aggregate** : creates a column family that automatically [aggregates data at write time](https://docs.cloud.google.com/bigtable/docs/aggregates). You can configure a garbage collection policy specific to the aggregation to manage data retention policies, such as [time buckets](https://docs.cloud.google.com/bigtable/docs/schema-design-time-series#time-buckets).
  4. If you selected **Aggregate** , in the **Aggregator** field, select one of the following options:

     * **Sum** : aggregates the sum of all cell values.
     * **Min** : aggregates the minimum cell value.
     * **Max** : aggregates the maximum cell value.
     * **HyperLogLog** : aggregates the approximate cardinality of cell values.
  5. Set the garbage collection policy for the column family.

  6. Click **Done**.




#### Add column families to an existing table

  1. In the Google Cloud console, open the list of Bigtable instances. 

[ Open the instance list ](https://console.cloud.google.com/bigtable/instances)

  2. Click the instance whose tables you want to view.

  3. Click **Tables** in the left pane.

The **Tables** page displays a list of tables in the instance.

  4. Click edit **Edit** for the table that you want to modify.

  5. For each column family that you want to add, do the following:

     1. Click **Add column family**.
     2. In the **Column family name** field, enter a unique identifier for the column family.
     3. Choose the column family type:

        * **Standard** : creates a standard column family that is managed by garbage collection policies.
        * **Aggregate** : creates a column family that automatically [aggregates data at write time](https://docs.cloud.google.com/bigtable/docs/aggregates). You can configure a garbage collection policy specific to the aggregation to manage data retention policies, such as [time buckets](https://docs.cloud.google.com/bigtable/docs/schema-design-time-series#time-buckets).
     4. If you selected **Aggregate** , in the **Aggregator** field, select one of the following options:

        * **Sum** : aggregates the sum of all cell values.
        * **Min** : aggregates the minimum cell value.
        * **Max** : aggregates the maximum cell value.
        * **HyperLogLog** : aggregates the approximate cardinality of cell values.
     5. Set the garbage collection policy for the column family.

     6. Click **Done**.

  6. Click **Save**.




###  gcloud 

You can't use the gcloud CLI to add column families to a table.

###  cbt 

To add a column family to a table, use the following command:
    
    
    cbt createfamily TABLE_ID FAMILY_NAME
    

For example, to add the column families `cf1` and `cf2` to the table `my-table`:
    
    
    cbt createfamily my-table cf1
    cbt createfamily my-table cf2
    

Optional: To add an [aggregate column family](https://docs.cloud.google.com/bigtable/docs/aggregates#aggregate-column-families) to the table, append the column family name with the aggregation type. The following creates a table that has an aggregate column family with a garbage collection policy of `never`.
    
    
    cbt createfamily TABLE_ID FAMILY_NAME:never:TYPE
    

Replace the following:

  * TABLE_ID: the table ID
  * FAMILY_NAME: : a comma-separated list of column family names. You can add more column families later.
  * TYPE: the aggregation type. Must be `intsum`, `intmin`, `intmax`, or `inthll`.



### Delete column families

You can delete column families in a table that does not have deletion protection enabled.

**Warning:** When you delete a column family, you also delete the data stored in that column family. Deleting a column family can't be undone.

###  Console 

  1. In the Google Cloud console, open the list of Bigtable instances. 

[ Open the instance list ](https://console.cloud.google.com/bigtable/instances)

  2. Click the instance whose tables you want to view.

  3. Click **Tables** in the left pane.

The **Tables** page displays a list of tables in the instance.

  4. Click edit **Edit** for the table that you want to modify.

  5. For each column family that you want to delete, complete the following:

     1. Mouse over the row for the column family that you want to delete.
     2. Click delete.
  6. Click **Save**.

  7. To confirm that you understand that deleting a column family is permanent and that all data in the column family will be deleted, type "Delete column families" in the text field.

  8. Click **Confirm**.




###  gcloud 

You can't use the gcloud CLI to delete column families from a table.

###  cbt 

To delete a column family from a table, use the following command, replacing `[TABLE_NAME]` with the table name and `[FAMILY_NAME]` with the column family name:
    
    
    cbt deletefamily [TABLE_NAME] [FAMILY_NAME]
    

For example, to delete the column family `cf2` from the table `my-table`:
    
    
    cbt deletefamily my-table cf2

## View information about a table

###  Console 

To view information about a table:

  1. In the Google Cloud console, open the list of Bigtable instances. 

[ Open the instance list ](https://console.cloud.google.com/bigtable/instances)

  2. Click the instance whose tables you want to view.

  3. Click **Tables** in the left pane.

The **Tables** page displays a list of tables in the instance. For each table, the Google Cloud console displays the number of clusters that the table is stored on, the table's status, storage utilization, and the identifiers for any current backups of the table. For tables with [tiered storage](https://docs.cloud.google.com/bigtable/docs/tiered-storage) ([Preview](https://cloud.google.com/products#product-launch-stages)) enabled, you can view the SSD storage utilization and the infrequent access storage utilization.

  4. To view column family names for the table, click edit. To close the **Edit table** pane, click **Cancel**.

  5. To view additional details about the table, including table-level metrics and replication state, click the name of the table.




###  gcloud 

To view information about a table, run the [`gcloud bigtable instances tables describe`](https://docs.cloud.google.com/sdk/gcloud/reference/bigtable/instances/tables/describe) command.
    
    
    gcloud bigtable instances tables describe TABLE_ID \
        --instance=INSTANCE_ID
    

Replace the following:

  * TABLE_ID: a unique ID of the table
  * INSTANCE_ID: the ID of the instance



###  cbt

You can use the `cbt` CLI to get a list of existing column families in a table.

Use the following command, replacing `[TABLE_NAME]` with the table name:
    
    
    cbt ls [TABLE_NAME]
    

## Set garbage collection policies

A [garbage collection](https://docs.cloud.google.com/bigtable/docs/garbage-collection) policy tells Bigtable which data to keep and which data to mark for deletion. You set garbage collection policies at the column family level when you create the table or later.

When you create a column family, you can specify the number of cells that you want to retain in every column in that column family. _If you do not specify_ this setting, Bigtable uses one of the following default settings:

  * **If you create the column family with the Cloud Bigtable HBase client for Java or the HBase shell,** or another tool that uses the HBase client for Java, Bigtable retains only 1 cell for each row or column intersection in the column family. This default setting is consistent with HBase.

  * **If you create the column family using the Google Cloud console, any other client library or the`cbt` CLI **, Bigtable retains an infinite number of cells in each column.




See [Configure garbage collection policies](https://docs.cloud.google.com/bigtable/docs/configuring-garbage-collection) for detailed instructions on how to view, set, and update garbage collection policies.

## Back up and restore a table

For instructions on how to back up a table and restore from a backup to a new table, see [Manage backups](https://docs.cloud.google.com/bigtable/docs/managing-backups).

If you have enabled automated backup while creating a table, then you can modify automated backup configuration for a table to enable or disable automated backup, or change the retention period to up to 90 days. For more information, see [Use automated backup](https://docs.cloud.google.com/bigtable/docs/managing-backups#use-automated-backup).

## Enable, disable, or configure a change stream

For instructions on the following tasks, see [Configure a change stream](https://docs.cloud.google.com/bigtable/docs/change-streams-configure).

  * Enabling a change stream on an existing table
  * Disabling a change stream
  * Update the retention period for a change stream



## Delete a table

Deleting a table also deletes all authorized views of the table. If any authorized views of the table have deletion protection enabled, you can't delete the table. You also can't delete a table that has a continuous materialized view based on it.

**Warning:** When you delete a table, you also delete the data stored in that table.

###  Console 

  1. In the Google Cloud console, open the list of Bigtable instances. 

[ Open the instance list ](https://console.cloud.google.com/bigtable/instances)

  2. Click the instance whose tables you want to view.

  3. Click **Tables** in the left pane.

The **Tables** page displays a list of tables in the instance.

  4. Click more_vert for the table that you want to delete.

  5. Click **Delete**.

  6. To confirm that you acknowledge that this action will delete the table from all clusters in the instance and that you have only seven days to undelete the table, type the table ID in the **Delete table** box.

  7. Click **Delete**.




###  gcloud 

  1. To delete tables, run the [`gcloud bigtable instances tables delete`](https://docs.cloud.google.com/sdk/gcloud/reference/bigtable/instances/tables/delete) command.
         
         gcloud bigtable instances tables delete TABLE_ID --instance=INSTANCE_ID
         

Replace the following:

     * TABLE_ID: the unique ID of the table
     * INSTANCE_ID: the ID of the instance
  2. In the terminal, enter `y` to confirm table deletion.




### cbt

To delete a table, use the following command, replacing `[TABLE_NAME]` with the table name:
    
    
    cbt deletetable [TABLE_NAME]
    

## Undelete a table

If you accidentally delete a table, you can use the gcloud CLI command [`bigtable instances tables undelete`](https://docs.cloud.google.com/sdk/gcloud/reference/bigtable/instances/tables/undelete) to _undelete_ , or recover, the table. Don't attempt to recreate the deleted table manually.

To undelete a table, run the following command in the terminal:
    
    
    gcloud bigtable instances tables undelete TABLE_ID --instance=INSTANCE_ID
    
    

Replace the following:

  * TABLE_ID: the unique identifier for the table
  * INSTANCE_ID: the ID of the instance



When you undelete a table, Bigtable enables deletion protection for the table automatically.

The following limitations apply:

  * The ability to undelete a table is available for _approximately_ seven days from the time of table deletion.
  * You can't undelete a table by using the Google Cloud console, the Cloud Bigtable client libraries, or the `cbt` CLI .
  * You can't undelete a table from an instance that was deleted.
  * You can't undelete a table that had CMEK enabled.
  * When you undelete a table, Bigtable doesn't restore any fine-grained IAM policy bindings to the deleted table.



You can optionally check the status of the `undelete` operation in the [audit logs](https://docs.cloud.google.com/bigtable/docs/audit-logging).

## Modify deletion protection

You can enable or disable deletion protection for a table if you are a principal in a role that includes the `bigtable.tables.update` permission, such as `roles/bigtable.admin`. Deletion protection prevents the deletion of the table, all column families in the table, and the instance that contains the table.

Enabling deletion protection for a table does not enable it for authorized views of the table. Similarly, disabling a table's deletion protection does not disable it for authorized views of the table. You must [update the table's authorized views](https://docs.cloud.google.com/bigtable/docs/control-access-with-authorized-views#modify-authorized-view) separately.

###  Console 

  1. In the Google Cloud console, open the list of Bigtable instances. 

[ Open the instance list ](https://console.cloud.google.com/bigtable/instances)

  2. Click the instance whose tables you want to view.

  3. Click **Tables** in the left pane.

The **Tables** page displays a list of tables in the instance.

  4. Click more_vert next to the table ID.

  5. To enable deletion protection, click **Prevent deletion**. To disable deletion protection, click **Enable deletion**. Only the valid option is visible.




###  gcloud 

To enable deletion protection for a table, run the [`gcloud bigtable instances table update`](https://docs.cloud.google.com/sdk/gcloud/reference/bigtable/instances/tables/update) command:
    
    
    ```sh
    gcloud bigtable instances tables update TABLE_ID \
        --instance=INSTANCE_ID \
        --deletion-protection
    ```
    

To disable deletion protection for a table, run the following:
    
    
    ```sh
    gcloud bigtable instances tables update TABLE_ID \
        --instance=INSTANCE_ID \
        --no-deletion-protection
    ```
    

Replace the following:
    
    
    + TABLE_ID: the unique identifier for the table
    + INSTANCE_ID: the ID of the instance
    

###  cbt 

You are not able to use the `cbt` CLI to enable or disable deletion protection.
