    public static void filterLimitColFamilyRegex() {
      // TODO(developer): Replace these variables before running the sample.
      String projectId = "my-project-id";
      String instanceId = "my-instance-id";
      String tableId = "mobile-time-series";
      filterLimitColFamilyRegex(projectId, instanceId, tableId);
    }
    
    public static void filterLimitColFamilyRegex(
        String projectId, String instanceId, String tableId) {
      // A filter that matches cells whose column family satisfies the given regex
      Filter filter = new FamilyFilter(CompareOp.EQUAL, new RegexStringComparator("stats_.*$"));
      Scan scan = new Scan().setFilter(filter);
      readWithFilter(projectId, instanceId, tableId, scan);
