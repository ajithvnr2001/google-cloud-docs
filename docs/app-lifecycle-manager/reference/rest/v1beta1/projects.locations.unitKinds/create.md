Create a new unit kind.

### HTTP request

`POST https://saasservicemgmt.googleapis.com/v1beta1/{parent=projects/*/locations/*}/unitKinds`

The URL uses [gRPC Transcoding](https://google.aip.dev/127) syntax.

### Path parameters

Parameters  
---  
`parent` |  `string` Required. The parent of the unit kind.  
  
### Query parameters

Parameters  
---  
`unitKindId` |  `string` Required. The ID value for the new unit kind.  
`validateOnly` |  `boolean` If "validateOnly" is set to true, the service will try to validate that this request would succeed, but will not actually make changes.  
`requestId` |  `string` An optional request ID to identify requests. Specify a unique request ID so that if you must retry your request, the server will know to ignore the request if it has already been completed. The server will guarantee that for at least 60 minutes since the first request.For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and the request times out. If you make the request again with the same request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments.The request ID must be a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID is not supported (00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000).  
  
### Request body

The request body contains an instance of `[UnitKind](https://docs.cloud.google.com/app-lifecycle-manager/reference/rest/v1beta1/projects.locations.unitKinds#UnitKind)`.

### Response body
