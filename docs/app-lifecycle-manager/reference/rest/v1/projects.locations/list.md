Lists information about the supported locations for this service.

This method lists locations based on the resource scope provided in the [ListLocationsRequest.name] field:

  * **Global locations** : If `name` is empty, the method lists the public locations available to all projects.
  * **Project-specific locations** : If `name` follows the format `projects/{project}`, the method lists locations visible to that specific project. This includes public, private, or other project-specific locations enabled for the project.



For gRPC and client library implementations, the resource name is passed as the `name` field. For direct service calls, the resource name is incorporated into the request path based on the specific service implementation and version.

### HTTP request

`GET https://saasservicemgmt.googleapis.com/v1/{name=projects/*}/locations`

The URL uses [gRPC Transcoding](https://google.aip.dev/127) syntax.

### Path parameters

Parameters  
---  
`name` |  `string` The resource that owns the locations collection, if applicable.  
  
### Query parameters

Parameters  
---  
`filter` |  `string` A filter to narrow down results to a preferred subset. The filtering language accepts strings like `"displayName=tokyo"`, and is documented in more detail in [AIP-160](https://google.aip.dev/160).  
`pageSize` |  `integer` The maximum number of results to return. If not set, the service selects a default.  
`pageToken` |  `string` A page token received from the `nextPageToken` field in the response. Send that page token to receive the subsequent page.  
`extraLocationTypes[]` |  `string` Optional. Do not use this field. It is unsupported and is ignored unless explicitly documented otherwise. This is primarily for internal usage.  
  
### Request body

The request body must be empty.

### Response body

If successful, the response body contains an instance of `[ListLocationsResponse](https://docs.cloud.google.com/app-lifecycle-manager/reference/rest/Shared.Types/ListLocationsResponse)`.

### Authorization scopes

Requires the following OAuth scope:

  * `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/cloud-platform`



For more information, see the [Authentication Overview](https://docs.cloud.google.com/docs/authentication#authorization-gcp).

### IAM Permissions

Requires the following [IAM](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs) permission on the `name` resource:

  * `saasservicemgmt.locations.list`



For more information, see the [IAM documentation](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs).
