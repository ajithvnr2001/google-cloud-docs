**Preview**

This product or feature is subject to the "Pre-GA Offerings Terms" in the General Service Terms section of the [Service Specific Terms](https://docs.cloud.google.com/terms/service-terms#1). Pre-GA products and features are available "as is" and might have limited support. For more information, see the [launch stage descriptions](https://cloud.google.com/products/#product-launch-stages). 

This document shows you how to use the App Lifecycle Manager remote Model Context Protocol (MCP) server to connect with AI applications including Antigravity, ChatGPT, Claude, and custom applications you are developing. The App Lifecycle Manager remote MCP server lets you manage App Lifecycle Manager resources like SaaSes, Tenants, and Units from your AI application. The App Lifecycle Manager remote MCP server is enabled when you enable the App Lifecycle Manager API. 

[Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs/getting-started/intro) (MCP) standardizes how large language models (LLMs) and AI applications or agents connect to external data sources. MCP servers let you use their tools, resources, and prompts to take actions and get updated data from their backend service.

## What's the difference between local and remote MCP servers?

Local MCP servers
    Typically run on your local machine and use the standard input and output streams (stdio) for communication between services on the same device.
Remote MCP servers
    Run on the service's infrastructure and offer an HTTP endpoint to AI applications for communication between the AI MCP client and the MCP server. For more information about MCP architecture, see [MCP architecture](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs/learn/architecture).

## Stateless core

With [MCP version 2026-07-28](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/2026-07-28), MCP changes from a bidirectional, stateful protocol to a stateless protocol. Each MCP request is self-describing and can be routed using headers. There isn't a need for the `initialize`/`initialized` handshake or `Mcp-Session-Id` because each request includes all the information needed in HTTP headers or the `_meta` parameter. MCP servers can request additional information required by a tool through [multi-round-trip requests (MRTR)](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/latest/basic/patterns/mrtr).

To help route and process requests without parsing the request body, some MCP headers are required, including the following:

  * Headers that are required by the MCP specification such as the [protocol version header](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/latest/basic/transports/streamable-http#protocol-version-header) and [standard request headers](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/latest/basic/transports/streamable-http#standard-request-headers).
  * [Custom headers](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/latest/basic/transports/streamable-http#custom-headers-from-tool-parameters) that are defined by the MCP server. These headers are mirrored into HTTP headers from the tool's input schema using the `x-mcp-header` property. For example, an MCP server might define a custom header to specify the Google Cloud region or project ID.



For more information about MCP architecture, see the MCP version 2026-07-28 [specification](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/2026-07-28) and [key changes](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/2026-07-28/changelog).

For information on the App Lifecycle Manager local MCP server, see [Use the App Lifecycle Manager local MCP server](https://docs.cloud.google.com/app-lifecycle-manager/use-app-lifecycle-manager-mcp).

## Before you begin

  1. Sign in to your Google Cloud account. If you're new to Google Cloud, [ create an account](https://console.cloud.google.com/freetrial) to evaluate how our products perform in real-world scenarios. New customers also get $300 in free credits to run, test, and deploy workloads. 
  2. In the Google Cloud console, on the project selector page, select or create a Google Cloud project.

**Roles required to select or create a project**

     * **Select a project** : Selecting a project doesn't require a specific IAM role—you can select any project that you've been granted a role on. 
     * **Create a project** : To create a project, you need the Project Creator role (`roles/resourcemanager.projectCreator`), which contains the `resourcemanager.projects.create` permission. [Learn how to grant roles](https://docs.cloud.google.com/iam/docs/granting-changing-revoking-access). 
**Note** : If you don't plan to keep the resources that you create in this procedure, create a project instead of selecting an existing project. After you finish these steps, you can delete the project, removing all resources associated with the project.

[Go to project selector](https://console.cloud.google.com/projectselector2/home/dashboard)

  3. Enable the App Lifecycle Manager API, if it is not already enabled. 

**Roles required to enable APIs**

To enable APIs, you need the `serviceusage.services.enable` permission. If you created the project, then you likely already have this permission through the Owner role (`roles/owner`). Otherwise, you can get this permission through the Service Usage Admin role (`roles/serviceusage.serviceUsageAdmin`). [Learn how to grant roles](https://docs.cloud.google.com/iam/docs/granting-changing-revoking-access). 

[Enable the API](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/enableflow?apiid=saasservicemgmt.googleapis.com)

  4. [Install](https://docs.cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/install) the Google Cloud CLI. 

**Note:** If you installed the gcloud CLI previously, make sure you have the latest version by running `gcloud components update`. 
  5. If you're using an external identity provider (IdP), you must first [ sign in to the gcloud CLI with your federated identity](https://docs.cloud.google.com/iam/docs/workforce-log-in-gcloud). 

  6. To [initialize](https://docs.cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/initializing) the gcloud CLI, run the following command: 
         
         gcloud init

  7. In the Google Cloud console, on the project selector page, select or create a Google Cloud project.

**Roles required to select or create a project**

  10. If you're using an external identity provider (IdP), you must first [ sign in to the gcloud CLI with your federated identity](https://docs.cloud.google.com/iam/docs/workforce-log-in-gcloud). 

  11. To [initialize](https://docs.cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/initializing) the gcloud CLI, run the following command: 
         
         gcloud init




### Required roles

To get the permissions that you need to use the App Lifecycle Manager MCP server, ask your administrator to grant you the following IAM roles on the project where you want to use the App Lifecycle Manager MCP server: 

  * Make MCP tool calls: [MCP Tool User ](https://docs.cloud.google.com/iam/docs/roles-permissions/mcp#mcp.toolUser) (`roles/mcp.toolUser`) 



For more information about granting roles, see [Manage access to projects, folders, and organizations](https://docs.cloud.google.com/iam/docs/granting-changing-revoking-access). 

These predefined roles contain the permissions required to use the App Lifecycle Manager MCP server. To see the exact permissions that are required, expand the **Required permissions** section: 

#### Required permissions

The following permissions are required to use the App Lifecycle Manager MCP server:

  * Make MCP tool calls: `mcp.tools.call`



You might also be able to get these permissions with [custom roles](https://docs.cloud.google.com/iam/docs/creating-custom-roles) or other [predefined roles](https://docs.cloud.google.com/iam/docs/roles-overview#predefined). 

## Authentication and authorization

The App Lifecycle Manager remote MCP server uses the [OAuth 2.0](https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/oauth2) protocol with [Identity and Access Management (IAM)](https://docs.cloud.google.com/iam/docs/overview) for authentication and authorization. All [Google Cloud identities](https://docs.cloud.google.com/docs/authentication/identity-products) are supported for authentication to MCP servers. 

The App Lifecycle Manager remote MCP server doesn't accept API keys.

We recommend that you create a separate identity for agents that are using MCP tools so that access to resources can be controlled and monitored. For more information about authentication, see [Authenticate to MCP servers](https://docs.cloud.google.com/mcp/authenticate-mcp).

## App Lifecycle Manager MCP OAuth scopes

OAuth 2.0 uses scopes and credentials to determine if an authenticated principal is authorized to take a specific action on a resource. For more information about OAuth 2.0 scopes at Google, read [Using OAuth 2.0 to access Google APIs](https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/oauth2).

App Lifecycle Manager has the following MCP tool OAuth scopes:

Scope URI for gcloud CLI | Description  
---|---  
`https://www.googleapis.com/auth/cloud-platform` | Allows access to all Google Cloud resources, including App Lifecycle Manager.  
  
## Configure an MCP client to use the App Lifecycle Manager MCP server

AI applications and agents, such as Claude or Antigravity, can instantiate an MCP client that connects to a single MCP server. An AI application can have multiple clients that connect to different MCP servers. If your application isn't listed in the [client-specific guidance](https://docs.cloud.google.com/mcp/configure-mcp-ai-application#client-specific-guidance), then you can use the following information to connect from most applications.

In your AI application, look for a way to add or connect to a remote MCP server. For the App Lifecycle Manager MCP server, enter the following information as required:

  * **Server name** : App Lifecycle Manager MCP server
  * **Server URL** or **Endpoint** : `https://saasservicemgmt.googleapis.com/mcp`
  * **Transport** : [Streamable HTTP](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/latest/basic/transports/streamable-http)
  * **Authentication details** : depending on how you want to authenticate, you can enter your Google Cloud credentials, your OAuth Client ID and secret, or an agent identity and credentials. For more information about authentication, see [Authenticate to MCP servers](https://docs.cloud.google.com/mcp/authenticate-mcp).
  * **OAuth scope** : the [OAuth 2.0 scope](https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/oauth2/scopes) that you want to use when connecting to the App Lifecycle Manager MCP server.



For application-specific guidance about setting up and connecting to MCP server, see [Client-specific guidance](https://docs.cloud.google.com/mcp/configure-mcp-ai-application#client-specific-guidance).

For more general guidance, see the following resources:

  * [Connect to remote MCP servers](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs/develop/connect-remote-servers).
  * [Configure MCP in an AI application](https://docs.cloud.google.com/mcp/configure-mcp-ai-application).



## Available tools

To view details of available MCP tools and their descriptions for the App Lifecycle Manager MCP server, see the [App Lifecycle Manager MCP reference](https://docs.cloud.google.com/app-lifecycle-manager/docs/reference/mcp).

### List tools

Use the [MCP inspector](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs/tools/inspector) to list tools, or send a `tools/list` HTTP request directly to the App Lifecycle Manager remote MCP server. The `tools/list` method doesn't require authentication.
    
    
    curl -X POST https://saasservicemgmt.googleapis.com/TOOLSET_ENDPOINT \
        -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
        -H 'Accept: application/json' \
        -H 'MCP-Protocol-Version: MCP_PROTOCOL_VERSION' \
        -H 'Mcp-Method: tools/list' \
        -d '{
          "jsonrpc": "2.0",
          "id": 1,
          "method": "tools/list",
          "params": {
            "_meta": {
              "io.modelcontextprotocol/protocolVersion": "MCP_PROTOCOL_VERSION",
              "io.modelcontextprotocol/clientCapabilities": {
                "extensions": {
                  "io.modelcontextprotocol/ui": {
                    "mimeTypes": ["text/html;profile=mcp-app"]
                  }
                }
              }
            }
          }
        }'
    

Replace the following:

  * `TOOLSET_ENDPOINT`: The remainder of the MCP endpoint after the service name. For example, for App Lifecycle Manager, this might be `mcp/toolset-name`.
  * `MCP_PROTOCOL_VERSION`: The MCP protocol version. For example, `2026-07-28`.
