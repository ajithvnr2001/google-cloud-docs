### HTTP request

Choose a location:

global me-central1 me-central2 me-west1 europe-west6 africa-south1 asia-east1 asia-east2 asia-northeast1 asia-northeast2 asia-northeast3 asia-south1 asia-south2 asia-southeast1 asia-southeast2 australia-southeast1 australia-southeast2 europe-central2 europe-north1 europe-north2 europe-southwest1 europe-west1 europe-west10 europe-west12 europe-west2 europe-west3 europe-west4 europe-west8 europe-west9 northamerica-northeast1 northamerica-northeast2 northamerica-south1 southamerica-east1 southamerica-west1 us-central1 us-east1 us-east4 us-east5 us-east7 us-south1 us-west1 us-west2 us-west3 us-west4 us-west8

  
`GET https://gkebackup.googleapis.com/v1/{name=projects/*/locations/*}/operations`

The URLs use [gRPC Transcoding](https://google.aip.dev/127) syntax.

### Path parameters

Parameters  
---  
`name` |  `string` The name of the operation's parent resource.  
  
### Query parameters

Parameters  
---  
`filter` |  `string` The standard list filter.  
`pageSize` |  `integer` The standard list page size.  
`pageToken` |  `string` The standard list page token.  
`returnPartialSuccess` |  `boolean` When set to `true`, operations that are reachable are returned as normal, and those that are unreachable are returned in the `[ListOperationsResponse.unreachable](https://docs.cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/add-on/backup-for-gke/reference/rest/v1/projects.locations.operations/list#body.ListOperationsResponse.FIELDS.unreachable)` field.This can only be `true` when reading across collections. For example, when `parent` is set to `"projects/example/locations/-"`.This field is not supported by default and will result in an `UNIMPLEMENTED` error if set unless explicitly documented otherwise in service or product specific documentation.  
  
### Request body

The request body must be empty.

### Response body

The response message for `[Operations.ListOperations](https://docs.cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/add-on/backup-for-gke/reference/rest/v1/projects.locations.operations/list#google.longrunning.Operations.ListOperations)`.

        }
      ],

`nextPageToken` |  `string` The standard List next-page token.  
`unreachable[]` |  `string` Unordered list. Unreachable resources. Populated when the request sets `ListOperationsRequest.return_partial_success` and reads across collections. For example, when attempting to list all resources across all supported locations.
