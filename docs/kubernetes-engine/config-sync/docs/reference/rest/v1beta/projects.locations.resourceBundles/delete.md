Deletes a single ResourceBundle.

### HTTP request

`DELETE https://configdelivery.googleapis.com/v1beta/{name=projects/*/locations/*/resourceBundles/*}`

The URL uses [gRPC Transcoding](https://google.aip.dev/127) syntax.

### Path parameters

Parameters  
---  
`name` |  `string` Required. Name of the resource  
  
### Query parameters

Parameters  
---  
`requestId` |  `string` Optional. An optional request ID to identify requests. Specify a unique request ID so that if you must retry your request, the server will know to ignore the request if it has already been completed. The server will guarantee that for at least 60 minutes after the first request.For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and the request times out. If you make the request again with the same request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments.The request ID must be a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID is not supported (00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000).  
`force` |  `boolean` Optional. If set to true, any releases of this resource bundle will also be deleted. (Otherwise, the request will only work if the resource bundle has no releases.)  
  
### Request body

The request body must be empty.

### Response body

If successful, the response body contains an instance of `[Operation](https://docs.cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/config-sync/docs/reference/rest/Shared.Types/ListOperationsResponse#Operation)`.

### Authorization scopes

Requires the following OAuth scope:

  * `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/cloud-platform`
