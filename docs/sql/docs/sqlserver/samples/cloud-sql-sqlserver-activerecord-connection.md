## Code sample

### Ruby

To authenticate to Cloud SQL for SQL Server, set up Application Default Credentials. For more information, see [Set up authentication for a local development environment](https://docs.cloud.google.com/docs/authentication/set-up-adc-local-dev-environment). 
    
    
    @vote = Vote.new candidate: candidate
    
    # ActiveRecord creates and executes your SQL and automatically
    # handles the opening and closing of the database connection.
    if @vote.save
      render json: "Vote successfully cast for \"#{@vote.candidate}\" at #{@vote.time_cast} PST!"
    else
      render json: @vote.errors, status: :unprocessable_entity
    end
