## Code sample

### Java

To authenticate to Cloud SQL for PostgreSQL, set up Application Default Credentials. For more information, see [Set up authentication for a local development environment](https://docs.cloud.google.com/docs/authentication/set-up-adc-local-dev-environment). 
    
    
    // maximumPoolSize limits the total number of concurrent connections this pool will keep. Ideal
    // values for this setting are highly variable on app design, infrastructure, and database.
    config.setMaximumPoolSize(5);
    // minimumIdle is the minimum number of idle connections Hikari maintains in the pool.
    // Additional connections will be established to meet this value unless the pool is full.
    config.setMinimumIdle(5);
