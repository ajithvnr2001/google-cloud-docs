This sample demonstrates how to create a source Cloud SQL for MySQL instance for cloning.

## Code sample

### Terraform

To learn how to apply or remove a Terraform configuration, see [Basic Terraform commands](https://docs.cloud.google.com/docs/terraform/basic-commands). For more information, see the [ Terraform provider reference documentation](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/google/latest/docs). 
    
    
    resource "google_sql_database_instance" "source" {
      name             = "mysql-instance-source-name"
      region           = "us-central1"
      database_version = "MYSQL_8_0"
      settings {
        tier = "db-n1-standard-2"
      }
      # set `deletion_protection` to true, will ensure that one cannot accidentally delete this instance by
      # use of Terraform whereas `deletion_protection_enabled` flag protects this instance at the GCP level.
      deletion_protection = false
    }
