## Code sample

### Java

To authenticate to Cloud SQL for MySQL, set up Application Default Credentials. For more information, see [Set up authentication for a local development environment](https://docs.cloud.google.com/docs/authentication/set-up-adc-local-dev-environment). 
    
    
    // maxLifetime is the maximum possible lifetime of a connection in the pool. Connections that
    // live longer than this many milliseconds will be closed and reestablished between uses. This
    // value should be several minutes shorter than the database's timeout value to avoid unexpected
    // terminations.
    config.setMaxLifetime(1800000); // 30 minutes
