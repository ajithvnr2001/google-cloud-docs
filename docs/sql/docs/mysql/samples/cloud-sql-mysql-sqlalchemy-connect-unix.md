## Code sample

### Python

To authenticate to Cloud SQL for MySQL, set up Application Default Credentials. For more information, see [Set up authentication for a local development environment](https://docs.cloud.google.com/docs/authentication/set-up-adc-local-dev-environment). 
    
    
    import os
    
    import sqlalchemy
    
    
    def connect_unix_socket() -> sqlalchemy.engine.base.Engine:
        """Initializes a Unix socket connection pool for a Cloud SQL instance of MySQL."""
        # Note: Saving credentials in environment variables is convenient, but not
        # secure - consider a more secure solution such as
        # Cloud Secret Manager (https://cloud.google.com/secret-manager) to help
        # keep secrets safe.
        db_user = os.environ["DB_USER"]  # e.g. 'my-database-user'
        db_pass = os.environ["DB_PASS"]  # e.g. 'my-database-password'
        db_name = os.environ["DB_NAME"]  # e.g. 'my-database'
        unix_socket_path = os.environ[
            "INSTANCE_UNIX_SOCKET"
        ]  # e.g. '/cloudsql/project:region:instance'
    
        pool = sqlalchemy.create_engine(
            # Equivalent URL:
            # mysql+pymysql://<db_user>:<db_pass>@/<db_name>?unix_socket=<socket_path>/<cloud_sql_instance_name>
            sqlalchemy.engine.url.URL.create(
                drivername="mysql+pymysql",
                username=db_user,
                password=db_pass,
                database=db_name,
                query={"unix_socket": unix_socket_path},
            ),
            # ...
        )
        return pool
