Lists operations that match the specified filter in the request. If the server doesn't support this method, it returns `UNIMPLEMENTED`.

### HTTP request

`GET https://servicenetworking.googleapis.com/v1/{name=operations}`

The URL uses [gRPC Transcoding](https://google.aip.dev/127) syntax.

### Path parameters

Parameters  
---  
`name` |  `string` The name of the operation's parent resource.  
  
### Query parameters

Parameters  
---  
`filter` |  `string` The standard list filter.  
`pageSize` |  `integer` The standard list page size.  
`pageToken` |  `string` The standard list page token.  
`returnPartialSuccess` |  `boolean` When set to `true`, operations that are reachable are returned as normal, and those that are unreachable are returned in the [ListOperationsResponse.unreachable] field.This can only be `true` when reading across collections e.g. when `parent` is set to `"projects/example/locations/-"`.This field is not by default supported and will result in an `UNIMPLEMENTED` error if set unless explicitly documented otherwise in service or product specific documentation.  
  
### Request body

The request body must be empty.

### Response body

The response message for `[Operations.ListOperations](https://docs.cloud.google.com/service-infrastructure/docs/service-networking/reference/rest/v1/operations/list#google.longrunning.Operations.ListOperations)`.

        }
      ],
      "nextPageToken": string,
      "unreachable": [
        string
      ]
    }  
  
Fields  
---  
`operations[]` |  `object (`[Operation](https://docs.cloud.google.com/service-infrastructure/docs/service-networking/reference/rest/v1/operations#Operation)`)` A list of operations that matches the specified filter in the request.  
`nextPageToken` |  `string` The standard List next-page token.  
`unreachable[]` |  `string` Unordered list. Unreachable resources. Populated when the request sets `ListOperationsRequest.return_partial_success` and reads across collections e.g. when attempting to list all resources across all supported locations.
