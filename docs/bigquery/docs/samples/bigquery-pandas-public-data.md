#  Download public table data to DataFrame Stay organized with collections  Save and categorize content based on your preferences. 

Use the BigQuery Storage API to speed up downloads of large tables to DataFrame.

## Code sample

### Python

Before trying this sample, follow the Python setup instructions in the [BigQuery quickstart using client libraries](https://docs.cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/quickstarts/quickstart-client-libraries). For more information, see the [BigQuery Python API reference documentation](https://docs.cloud.google.com/python/docs/reference/bigquery/latest). 

To authenticate to BigQuery, set up Application Default Credentials. For more information, see [Set up authentication for client libraries](https://docs.cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/authentication#client-libs). 
    
    
    from google.cloud import [bigquery](https://docs.cloud.google.com/python/docs/reference/bigquery/latest)
    
    # Construct a BigQuery client object.
    client = [bigquery](https://docs.cloud.google.com/python/docs/reference/bigquery/latest).[Client](https://docs.cloud.google.com/python/docs/reference/bigquery/latest/google.cloud.bigquery.client.Client.html)()
    
    # TODO(developer): Set table_id to the fully-qualified table ID in standard
    # SQL format, including the project ID and dataset ID.
    table_id = "bigquery-public-data.usa_names.usa_1910_current"
    
    # Use the BigQuery Storage API to speed-up downloads of large tables.
    dataframe = client.[list_rows](https://docs.cloud.google.com/python/docs/reference/bigquery/latest/google.cloud.bigquery.client.Client.html#google_cloud_bigquery_client_Client_list_rows)(table_id).to_dataframe(create_bqstorage_client=True)
    
    print(dataframe.info())
