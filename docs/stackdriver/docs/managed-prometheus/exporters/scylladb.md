This document describes how to configure your Google Kubernetes Engine deployment so that you can use Google Cloud Managed Service for Prometheus to collect metrics from ScyllaDB. This document shows you how to do the following: 

  * Set up ScyllaDB to report metrics.
  * Access a predefined dashboard in Cloud Monitoring to view the metrics.
  * Configure alerting rules to monitor the metrics.



These instructions apply only if you are using [ managed collection](https://docs.cloud.google.com/stackdriver/docs/managed-prometheus/setup-managed) with Managed Service for Prometheus. If you are using self-deployed collection, then see the [ScyllaDB documentation](https://monitoring.docs.scylladb.com/stable/reference/monitoring-apis) for installation information.

These instructions are provided as an example and are expected to work in most Kubernetes environments. If you are having trouble installing an application or exporter due to restrictive security or organizational policies, then we recommend you consult open-source documentation for support.

For information about ScyllaDB, see [ScyllaDB](https://www.scylladb.com/). 

## Prerequisites

To collect metrics from the ScyllaDB exporter by using Managed Service for Prometheus and managed collection, your deployment must meet the following requirements: 

  * Your cluster must be running Google Kubernetes Engine version 1.28.15-gke.2475000 or later.
  * You must be running Managed Service for Prometheus with managed collection enabled. For more information, see [ Get started with managed collection](https://docs.cloud.google.com/stackdriver/docs/managed-prometheus/setup-managed).
  * To use dashboards available in Cloud Monitoring for the ScyllaDB integration, you must use `scylladb_monitoring_stack` version 5.0 or later. 

For more information about available dashboards, see View dashboards. 




## Modify the ScyllaDB configuration

Modify the ScyllaDB configuration as shown in the following example:

    apiVersion: apps/v1
    kind: Deployment
    metadata:
      name: scylladb
    spec:
      selector:
        matchLabels:
          app.kubernetes.io/name: scylladb
      template:
        metadata:
          labels:
            app.kubernetes.io/name: scylladb
        spec:
          containers:
          - name: scylladb
            image: scylladb/scylla:5.0.5
    +       ports:
    +       - containerPort: 9180
    +         name: prometheus
    

You must add any lines preceded by the `+` symbol to your configuration.

To apply configuration changes from a local file, run the following command: 
    
    
    kubectl apply -n NAMESPACE_NAME -f FILE_NAME
    

You can also [use Terraform](https://docs.cloud.google.com/stackdriver/docs/managed-prometheus/setup-managed#terraform-scrape) to manage your configurations.

## Define a PodMonitoring resource

For target discovery, the Managed Service for Prometheus Operator requires a PodMonitoring resource that corresponds to the ScyllaDB exporter in the same namespace.

You can use the following PodMonitoring configuration:

    # you may not use this file except in compliance with the License.

    apiVersion: monitoring.googleapis.com/v1
    kind: PodMonitoring
    metadata:

      labels:
        app.kubernetes.io/name: scylladb
        app.kubernetes.io/part-of: google-cloud-managed-prometheus
    spec:
      endpoints:
      - port: prometheus
        interval: 30s
        path: /metrics
      selector:
        matchLabels:
          app.kubernetes.io/name: scylladb
    

To apply configuration changes from a local file, run the following command: 
    
    
    kubectl apply -n NAMESPACE_NAME -f FILE_NAME
    

You can also [use Terraform](https://docs.cloud.google.com/stackdriver/docs/managed-prometheus/setup-managed#terraform-scrape) to manage your configurations.

## Define rules and alerts

You can use the following `Rules` configuration to define alerts on your ScyllaDB metrics:
    
    
    # Copyright 2023 Google LLC
    #
    # Licensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0 (the "License");
    # you may not use this file except in compliance with the License.

    apiVersion: monitoring.googleapis.com/v1
    kind: Rules
    metadata:
      name: scylladb-rules
      labels:
        app.kubernetes.io/component: rules
        app.kubernetes.io/name: scylladb-rules
        app.kubernetes.io/part-of: google-cloud-managed-prometheus
    spec:
      groups:
      - name: scylladb
        interval: 30s
        rules:
        - alert: ScyllaDBHighCompactionLoad
          annotations:
            description: |-
              ScyllaDB high compaction load
                VALUE = {{ $value }}
                LABELS: {{ $labels }}
            summary: ScyllaDB high compaction load (instance {{ $labels.instance }})
          expr: scylla_scheduler_shares{group="compaction"} >= 1000
          for: 5m
          labels:
            severity: critical
        - alert: ScyllaDBHighPreparedStatementEvictionRate
          annotations:
            description: |-
              ScyllaDB high prepared statement eviction rate
                VALUE = {{ $value }}
                LABELS: {{ $labels }}
            summary: ScyllaDB high prepared statement eviction rate (instance {{ $labels.instance }})
          expr: (scylla_cql_prepared_cache_evictions + scylla_cql_authorized_prepared_statements_cache_evictions) > 100
          for: 5m
          labels:
            severity: warning
    

To apply configuration changes from a local file, run the following command: 
    
    
    kubectl apply -n NAMESPACE_NAME -f FILE_NAME
    

You can also [use Terraform](https://docs.cloud.google.com/stackdriver/docs/managed-prometheus/setup-managed#terraform-scrape) to manage your configurations.

For more information about applying rules to your cluster, see [Managed rule evaluation and alerting](https://docs.cloud.google.com/stackdriver/docs/managed-prometheus/rules-managed).

You can adjust the alert thresholds to suit your application. 

## Verify the configuration

You can use Metrics Explorer to verify that you correctly configured the ScyllaDB exporter. It might take one or two minutes for Cloud Monitoring to ingest your metrics.

To verify the metrics are ingested, do the following: 

  1. In the Google Cloud console, go to the _leaderboard_ **Metrics explorer** page: 

[Go to **Metrics explorer**](https://console.cloud.google.com/monitoring/metrics-explorer)

If you use the search bar to find this page, then select the result whose subheading is **Monitoring**.

  2. In the toolbar of the query-builder pane, select the button whose name is _code_ **PromQL**.
  3. Enter and run the following query:  

         
         up{job="scylladb", cluster="CLUSTER_NAME", namespace="NAMESPACE_NAME"}




## View dashboards

The Cloud Monitoring integration includes the **ScyllaDB Prometheus Overview** dashboard. Dashboards are automatically installed when you configure the integration. You can also view static previews of dashboards without installing the integration. 

To view an installed dashboard, do the following: 

  1. In the Google Cloud console, go to the dashboard **Dashboards** page: 

[Go to **Dashboards**](https://console.cloud.google.com/monitoring/dashboards)

If you use the search bar to find this page, then select the result whose subheading is **Monitoring**.

  2. Select the **Dashboard List** tab.
  3. Choose the **Integrations** category.
  4. Click the name of the dashboard, for example, **ScyllaDB Prometheus Overview**.



To view a static preview of the dashboard, do the following: 

  1. In the Google Cloud console, go to the ![](https://docs.cloud.google.com/static/monitoring/images/integrations-icon.png) **Integrations** page: 

[Go to **Integrations**](https://console.cloud.google.com/monitoring/integrations)

If you use the search bar to find this page, then select the result whose subheading is **Monitoring**.

  2. Click the **Kubernetes Engine** deployment-platform filter.
  3. Locate the ScyllaDB integration and click **View Details**.
  4. Select the **Dashboards** tab.
