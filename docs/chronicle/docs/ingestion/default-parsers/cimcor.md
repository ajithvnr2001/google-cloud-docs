# Collect Cimcor CimTrak logs

**Parser Version:** 1.0

Supported in:

Google SecOps  [ SIEM ](https://docs.cloud.google.com/chronicle/docs/secops/google-secops-siem-toc)

This document explains how to ingest Cimcor CimTrak logs to Google Security Operations using the Bindplane agent.

Cimcor CimTrak is a file integrity monitoring (FIM) platform for detecting unauthorized changes to files, configurations, and system settings. The platform provides real-time integrity monitoring events with full forensic context, including who, what, when, and how a change occurred. CimTrak supports multiple log output formats including CEF (Common Event Format), LEEF (Log Event Extended Format), and MEF (Micro Event Format).

## Before you begin

Make sure you have the following prerequisites:

  * A Google SecOps instance
  * Windows Server 2016 or later, or Linux host with `systemd`
  * Network connectivity between the Bindplane agent and Cimcor CimTrak
  * If running behind a proxy, ensure firewall ports are open per the Bindplane agent requirements
  * Privileged access to the Cimcor CimTrak management console with administrator permissions



## Get a Google SecOps ingestion authentication file

  1. Sign in to the Google SecOps console.
  2. Go to **SIEM Settings > Collection Agents**.
  3. Download the **Ingestion Authentication File**.
  4. Save the file securely on the system where Bindplane will be installed.

**Note:** This JSON file contains credentials for authenticating the Bindplane agent to Google SecOps.



## Get a Google SecOps customer ID

  1. Sign in to the Google SecOps console.
  2. Go to **SIEM Settings > Profile**.
  3. Copy and save the **Customer ID** from the **Organization Details** section.

**Note:** The customer ID is required for configuring the Bindplane agent exporter.



## Install the Bindplane agent

Install the Bindplane agent on your Windows or Linux operating system according to the following instructions.

### Windows installation

  1. Open **Command Prompt** or **PowerShell** as an administrator.
  2. Run the following command:
         
         msiexec /i "https://github.com/observIQ/bindplane-agent/releases/latest/download/observiq-otel-collector.msi" /quiet
         

  3. Wait for the installation to complete.

  4. Verify the installation by running:
         
         sc query observiq-otel-collector
         

The service should show as **RUNNING**.




### Linux installation

  1. Open a terminal with root or sudo privileges.
  2. Run the following command:
         
         sudo sh -c "$(curl -fsSlL https://github.com/observiq/bindplane-agent/releases/latest/download/install_unix.sh)" install_unix.sh
         

  3. Wait for the installation to complete.

  4. Verify the installation by running:
         
         sudo systemctl status observiq-otel-collector
         

The service should show as **active (running)**.




### Additional installation resources

For additional installation options and troubleshooting, see the [Bindplane agent installation guide](https://docs.cloud.google.com/chronicle/docs/ingestion/use-bindplane-agent#install_the_bindplane_agent).

                logs/cimtrak_to_chronicle:
                    receivers:
                        - tcplog
                    exporters:

## Configure Cimcor CimTrak syslog forwarding

  1. Sign in to the **CimTrak management console** with administrator credentials.
  2. Navigate to **Administration > System** or **Event Forwarding** settings.
  3. Locate the **SIEM Integration** or **Syslog** configuration section.
  4. Configure the following parameters:

Setting | Value  
---|---  
**Syslog server IP/hostname** | Enter the IP address or hostname of the Bindplane agent host  
**Port** | Enter the port matching the Bindplane agent receiver configuration (for example, `514`)  
**Protocol** | Select **TCP** or **UDP** to match the Bindplane receiver type  
**Log format** | Select **CEF** , **LEEF** , or **MEF** based on your requirements  
  5. (Optional) Configure a filter to send only specific event categories (for example, critical alerts only) or all events.

  6. Click **Save** and verify that events appear in the Bindplane agent logs.

**Note:** The exact UI navigation may vary depending on your CimTrak version. For detailed instructions specific to your version, refer to the SIEM Integration section in your CimTrak product documentation or contact [Cimcor support](https://www.cimcor.com/).
