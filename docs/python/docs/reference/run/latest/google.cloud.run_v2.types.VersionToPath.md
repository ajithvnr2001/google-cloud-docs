    VersionToPath(mapping=None, *, ignore_unknown_fields=False, **kwargs)

VersionToPath maps a specific version of a secret to a relative file to mount to, relative to VolumeMount's mount_path.

## Attributes  
  
---  
**Name** | **Description**  
`path` |  `str`   
Required. The relative path of the secret in the container.   
`version` |  `str`   
The Cloud Secret Manager secret version. Can be 'latest' for the latest value, or an integer or a secret alias for a specific version.   
`mode` |  `int`   
Integer octal mode bits to use on this file, must be a value between 01 and 0777 (octal). If 0 or not set, the Volume's default mode will be used. Notes \- Internally, a umask of 0222 will be applied to any non-zero value. \- This is an integer representation of the mode bits. So, the octal integer value should look exactly as the chmod numeric notation with a leading zero. Some examples: for chmod 640 (u=rw,g=r), set to 0640 (octal) or 416 (base-10). For chmod 755 (u=rwx,g=rx,o=rx), set to 0755 (octal) or 493 (base-10). \- This might be in conflict with other options that affect the file mode, like fsGroup, and the result can be other mode bits set.
