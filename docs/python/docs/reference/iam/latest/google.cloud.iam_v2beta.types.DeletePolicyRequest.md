Request message for `DeletePolicy`.

## Attributes  
  
---  
**Name** | **Description**  
`name` |  `str`   
Required. The resource name of the policy to delete. Format: `policies/{attachment_point}/denypolicies/{policy_id}` Use the URL-encoded full resource name, which means that the forward-slash character, `/`, must be written as `%2F`. For example, `policies/cloudresourcemanager.googleapis.com%2Fprojects%2Fmy-project/denypolicies/my-policy`. For organizations and folders, use the numeric ID in the full resource name. For projects, you can use the alphanumeric or the numeric ID.   
`etag` |  `str`   
Optional. The expected `etag` of the policy to delete. If the value does not match the value that is stored in IAM, the request fails with a `409` error code and `ABORTED` status. If you omit this field, the policy is deleted regardless of its current `etag`.
