## Attributes  
  
---  
**Name** | **Description**  
`scope` |  `str`   
Required. The organization to scope the request. Only organization policies within the scope will be analyzed. The output assets will also be limited to the ones governed by those in-scope organization policies. \- organizations/{ORGANIZATION_NUMBER} (e.g., "organizations/123456")   
`constraint` |  `str`   
Required. The name of the constraint to analyze governed assets for. The analysis only contains analyzed organization policies for the provided constraint.   
`filter` |  `str`   
The expression to filter AnalyzeOrgPolicyGovernedAssetsResponse.governed_assets. For governed resources, filtering is currently available for bare literal values and the following fields: \- governed_resource.project \- governed_resource.folders \- consolidated_policy.rules.enforce When filtering by `governed_resource.project` or `consolidated_policy.rules.enforce`, the only supported operator is `=`. When filtering by `governed_resource.folders`, the supported operators are `=` and `:`. For example, filtering by `governed_resource.project="projects/12345678"` will return all the governed resources under "projects/12345678", including the project itself if applicable. For governed IAM policies, filtering is currently available for bare literal values and the following fields: \- governed_iam_policy.project \- governed_iam_policy.folders \- consolidated_policy.rules.enforce When filtering by `governed_iam_policy.project` or `consolidated_policy.rules.enforce`, the only supported operator is `=`. When filtering by `governed_iam_policy.folders`, the supported operators are `=` and `:`. For example, filtering by `governed_iam_policy.folders:"folders/12345678"` will return all the governed IAM policies under "folders/001".   
`page_size` |  `int`   
The maximum number of items to return per page. If unspecified, AnalyzeOrgPolicyGovernedAssetsResponse.governed_assets will contain 100 items with a maximum of 200. This field is a member of `oneof`_ `_page_size`.   
`page_token` |  `str`   
The pagination token to retrieve the next page.
