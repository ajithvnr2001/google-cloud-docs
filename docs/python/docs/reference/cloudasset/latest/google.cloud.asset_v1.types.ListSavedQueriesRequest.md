Request to list saved queries.

## Attributes  
  
---  
**Name** | **Description**  
`parent` |  `str`   
Required. The parent project/folder/organization whose savedQueries are to be listed. It can only be using project/folder/organization number (such as "folders/12345")", or a project ID (such as "projects/my-project-id").   
`filter` |  `str`   
Optional. The expression to filter resources. The expression is a list of zero or more restrictions combined via logical operators `AND` and `OR`. When `AND` and `OR` are both used in the expression, parentheses must be appropriately used to group the combinations. The expression may also contain regular expressions. See https://google.aip.dev/160 for more information on the grammar.   
`page_size` |  `int`   
Optional. The maximum number of saved queries to return per page. The service may return fewer than this value. If unspecified, at most 50 will be returned. The maximum value is 1000; values above 1000 will be coerced to 1000.   
`page_token` |  `str`   
Optional. A page token, received from a previous `ListSavedQueries` call. Provide this to retrieve the subsequent page. When paginating, all other parameters provided to `ListSavedQueries` must match the call that provided the page token.
