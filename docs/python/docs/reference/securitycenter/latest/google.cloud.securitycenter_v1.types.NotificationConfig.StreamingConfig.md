## Attribute  
  
---  
**Name** | **Description**  
`filter` |  `str`   
Expression that defines the filter to apply across create/update events of assets or findings as specified by the event type. The expression is a list of zero or more restrictions combined via logical operators `AND` and `OR`. Parentheses are supported, and `OR` has higher precedence than `AND`. Restrictions have the form `` and may have a `-` character in front of them to indicate negation. The fields map to those defined in the corresponding resource. The supported operators are: \- `=` for all value types. \- `>`, ``, `>=`, `<>` for integer values. \- `:`, meaning substring matching, for strings. The supported value types are: \- string literals in quotes. \- integer literals without quotes. \- boolean literals `true` and `false` without quotes.
