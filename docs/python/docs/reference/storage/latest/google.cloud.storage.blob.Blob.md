## Methods 

### Blob
    
    
    Blob(
        name,
        bucket,
        chunk_size=None,
        encryption_key=None,
        kms_key_name=None,
        generation=None,
    )

property `name` Get the blob's name.

### compose
    
    
    compose(
        sources,
        client=None,
        timeout=60,
        if_generation_match=None,
        if_metageneration_match=None,
        if_source_generation_match=None,
        retry=google.cloud.storage.retry.ConditionalRetryPolicy,
        destination_contexts=None,
        delete_source_objects=None,
    )

Concatenate source blobs into this one.

If `user_project` is set on the bucket, bills the API request to that project.

See [API reference docs](https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/json_api/v1/objects/compose) and a [code sample](https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/samples/storage-compose-file#storage_compose_file-python).

**Parameters**  
---  
**Name** | **Description**  
`sources` |  `list of `Blob``   
Blobs whose contents will be composed into this blob.  
`client` |  `[Client](https://docs.cloud.google.com/python/docs/reference/storage/latest/google.cloud.storage.client.Client)`   
(Optional) The client to use. If not passed, falls back to the `client` stored on the blob's bucket.  
`timeout` |  `float or tuple`   
(Optional) The amount of time, in seconds, to wait for the server response. See: `configuring_timeouts`  
`if_generation_match` |  `long`   
(Optional) Makes the operation conditional on whether the destination object's current generation matches the given value. Setting to 0 makes the operation succeed only if there are no live versions of the object. Note: In a previous version, this argument worked identically to the `if_source_generation_match` argument. For backwards-compatibility reasons, if a list is passed in, this argument will behave like `if_source_generation_match` and also issue a DeprecationWarning.  
`if_metageneration_match` |  `long`   
(Optional) Makes the operation conditional on whether the destination object's current metageneration matches the given value. If a list of long is passed in, no match operation will be performed. (Deprecated: type(list of long) is supported for backwards-compatability reasons only.)  
`if_source_generation_match` |  `list of long`   
(Optional) Makes the operation conditional on whether the current generation of each source blob matches the corresponding generation. The list must match `sources` item-to-item.  
`retry` |  `google.api_core.retry.Retry or [google.cloud.storage.retry.ConditionalRetryPolicy](https://docs.cloud.google.com/python/docs/reference/storage/latest/google.cloud.storage.retry.ConditionalRetryPolicy)`   
(Optional) How to retry the RPC. The default value is `DEFAULT_RETRY_IF_GENERATION_SPECIFIED`, a conditional retry policy which will only enable retries if `if_generation_match` or `generation` is set, in order to ensure requests are idempotent before retrying them. Change the value to `DEFAULT_RETRY` or another `google.api_core.retry.Retry` object to enable retries regardless of generation precondition setting. See [Configuring Retries](https://cloud.google.com/python/docs/reference/storage/latest/retry_timeout).  
`destination_contexts` |  `[ObjectContexts](https://docs.cloud.google.com/python/docs/reference/storage/latest/google.cloud.storage.blob.ObjectContexts)`   
(Optional) New contexts to set for the destination object. See: <https://docs.cloud.google.com/storage/docs/use-object-contexts#manage_object_contexts_during_object_operations>  
`delete_source_objects` |  `bool`   
(Optional) If True, the source objects will be deleted after a successful composition.  
  
### create_resumable_upload_session
    
    
    create_resumable_upload_session(
        content_type=None,
        size=None,
        origin=None,
        client=None,
        timeout=60,
        checksum="auto",
        predefined_acl=None,
        if_generation_match=None,
        if_generation_not_match=None,
        if_metageneration_match=None,
        if_metageneration_not_match=None,
        retry=google.api_core.retry.retry_unary.Retry,
    )

Create a resumable upload session.

Resumable upload sessions allow you to start an upload session from one client and complete the session in another. This method is called by the initiator to set the metadata and limits. The initiator then passes the session URL to the client that will upload the binary data. The client performs a PUT request on the session URL to complete the upload. This process allows untrusted clients to upload to an access-controlled bucket.

For more details, see the documentation on [`signed URLs`](https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/access-control/signed-urls#signing-resumable).

The content type of the upload will be determined in order of precedence:

  * The value passed in to this method (if not :data:`None`)
  * The value stored on the current blob
  * The default value ('application/octet-stream')



**Note:** The effect of uploading to an existing blob depends on the "versioning" and "lifecycle" policies defined on the blob's bucket. In the absence of those policies, upload will overwrite any existing contents.  See the [`object versioning`](https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/object-versioning) and [`lifecycle`](https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/lifecycle) API documents for details.

If `encryption_key` is set, the blob will be encrypted with a [`customer-supplied`](https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/encryption#customer-supplied) encryption key.

If `user_project` is set on the bucket, bills the API request to that project.

**Parameters**  
---  
**Name** | **Description**  
`size` |  `int`   
(Optional) The maximum number of bytes that can be uploaded using this session. If the size is not known when creating the session, this should be left blank.  
`content_type` |  `str`   
(Optional) Type of content being uploaded.  
`origin` |  `str`   
(Optional) If set, the upload can only be completed by a user-agent that uploads from the given origin. This can be useful when passing the session to a web client.  
`client` |  `[Client](https://docs.cloud.google.com/python/docs/reference/storage/latest/google.cloud.storage.client.Client)`   
(Optional) The client to use. If not passed, falls back to the `client` stored on the blob's bucket.  
`timeout` |  `float or tuple`   
(Optional) The amount of time, in seconds, to wait for the server response. See: `configuring_timeouts`  
`checksum` |  `str`   
(Optional) The type of checksum to compute to verify the integrity of the object. After the upload is complete, the server-computed checksum of the resulting object will be checked and [google.cloud.storage.exceptions.DataCorruption](https://docs.cloud.google.com/python/docs/reference/storage/latest/google.cloud.storage.exceptions.DataCorruption) will be raised on a mismatch. On a validation failure, the client will attempt to delete the uploaded object automatically. Supported values are "md5", "crc32c", "auto" and None. The default is "auto", which will try to detect if the C extension for crc32c is installed and fall back to md5 otherwise.  
`predefined_acl` |  `str`   
(Optional) Predefined access control list  
`if_generation_match` |  `long`   
(Optional) See :ref:`using-if-generation-match`  
`if_generation_not_match` |  `long`   
(Optional) See :ref:`using-if-generation-not-match`  
`if_metageneration_match` |  `long`   
(Optional) See :ref:`using-if-metageneration-match`  
`if_metageneration_not_match` |  `long`   
(Optional) See :ref:`using-if-metageneration-not-match`  
`retry` |  `google.api_core.retry.Retry or [google.cloud.storage.retry.ConditionalRetryPolicy](https://docs.cloud.google.com/python/docs/reference/storage/latest/google.cloud.storage.retry.ConditionalRetryPolicy)`   
(Optional) How to retry the RPC. A None value will disable retries. A google.api_core.retry.Retry value will enable retries, and the object will define retriable response codes and errors and configure backoff and timeout options. A [google.cloud.storage.retry.ConditionalRetryPolicy](https://docs.cloud.google.com/python/docs/reference/storage/latest/google.cloud.storage.retry.ConditionalRetryPolicy) value wraps a Retry object and activates it only if certain conditions are met. This class exists to provide safe defaults for RPC calls that are not technically safe to retry normally (due to potential data duplication or other side-effects) but become safe to retry if a condition such as if_generation_match is set. See the retry.py source code and docstrings in this package ([google.cloud.storage.retry](https://docs.cloud.google.com/python/docs/reference/storage/latest/google.cloud.storage.retry)) for information on retry types and how to configure them.  
**Exceptions**  
---  
**Type** | **Description**  
`GoogleCloudError` | if the session creation response returns an error status.  
**Returns**  
---  
**Type** | **Description**  
`str` | The resumable upload session URL. The upload can be completed by making an HTTP PUT request with the file's contents.

        client=None,
        if_generation_match=None,

(Optional) The client to use. If not passed, falls back to the `client` stored on the blob's bucket.  
`start` |  `int`   
(Optional) The first byte in a range to be downloaded.  
`end` |  `int`   
(Optional) The last byte in a range to be downloaded.  
`raw_download` |  `bool`   
(Optional) If true, download the object without any expansion.

(Optional) The amount of time, in seconds, to wait for the server response. See: `configuring_timeouts`  
`checksum` |  `str`   
(Optional) The type of checksum to compute to verify the integrity of the object. The response headers must contain a checksum of the requested type. If the headers lack an appropriate checksum (for instance in the case of transcoded or ranged downloads where the remote service does not know the correct checksum, including downloads where chunk_size is set) an INFO-level log will be emitted. Supported values are "md5", "crc32c", "auto" and None. The default is "auto", which will try to detect if the C extension for crc32c is installed and fall back to md5 otherwise.  
`retry` |  `google.api_core.retry.Retry or [google.cloud.storage.retry.ConditionalRetryPolicy](https://docs.cloud.google.com/python/docs/reference/storage/latest/google.cloud.storage.retry.ConditionalRetryPolicy)`   
(Optional) How to retry the RPC. A None value will disable retries. A google.api_core.retry.Retry value will enable retries, and the object will define retriable response codes and errors and configure backoff and timeout options. A [google.cloud.storage.retry.ConditionalRetryPolicy](https://docs.cloud.google.com/python/docs/reference/storage/latest/google.cloud.storage.retry.ConditionalRetryPolicy) value wraps a Retry object and activates it only if certain conditions are met. This class exists to provide safe defaults for RPC calls that are not technically safe to retry normally (due to potential data duplication or other side-effects) but become safe to retry if a condition such as if_metageneration_match is set. See the retry.py source code and docstrings in this package ([google.cloud.storage.retry](https://docs.cloud.google.com/python/docs/reference/storage/latest/google.cloud.storage.retry)) for information on retry types and how to configure them.  
`single_shot_download` |  `bool`   
(Optional) If true, download the object in a single request. Caution: Enabling this will increase the memory overload for your application. Please enable this as per your use case.

### generate_signed_url
    
    
    generate_signed_url(
        expiration=None,
        api_access_endpoint=None,
        method="GET",
        content_md5=None,
        content_type=None,
        response_disposition=None,
        response_type=None,
        generation=None,
        headers=None,
        query_parameters=None,

        virtual_hosted_style=False,
        bucket_bound_hostname=None,
        scheme="http",
    )

Generates a signed URL for this blob.

**Note:** If you are on Google Compute Engine, you can't generate a signed URL using GCE service account. If you'd like to be able to generate a signed URL from GCE, you can use a standard service account from a JSON file rather than a GCE service account.  See a [code sample](https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/samples/storage-generate-signed-url-v4#storage_generate_signed_url_v4-python).

This is particularly useful if you don't want publicly accessible blobs, but don't want to require users to explicitly log in.

If `bucket_bound_hostname` is set as an argument of `api_access_endpoint`, `https` works only if using a `CDN`.

**Parameters**  
---  
**Name** | **Description**  
`expiration` |  `Union[Integer, datetime.datetime, datetime.timedelta]`   
Point in time when the signed URL should expire. If a `datetime` instance is passed without an explicit `tzinfo` set, it will be assumed to be `UTC`.  
`api_access_endpoint` |  `str`   
(Optional) URI base, for instance "<https://storage.googleapis.com>". If not specified, the client's api_endpoint will be used. Incompatible with bucket_bound_hostname.  
`method` |  `str`   
The HTTP verb that will be used when requesting the URL.  
`content_md5` |  `str`   
(Optional) The MD5 hash of the object referenced by `resource`.  
`content_type` |  `str`   
(Optional) The content type of the object referenced by `resource`.  
`response_disposition` |  `str`   
(Optional) Content disposition of responses to requests for the signed URL. For example, to enable the signed URL to initiate a file of `blog.png`, use the value `'attachment; filename=blob.png'`.  
`response_type` |  `str`   
(Optional) Content type of responses to requests for the signed URL. Ignored if content_type is set on object/blob metadata.  
`generation` |  `str`   
(Optional) A value that indicates which generation of the resource to fetch.  
`headers` |  `dict`   
(Optional) Additional HTTP headers to be included as part of the signed URLs. See: <https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/xml-api/reference-headers> Requests using the signed URL _must_ pass the specified header (name and value) with each request for the URL.  
`query_parameters` |  `dict`   
(Optional) Additional query parameters to be included as part of the signed URLs. See: <https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/xml-api/reference-headers#query>  
`client` |  `[Client](https://docs.cloud.google.com/python/docs/reference/storage/latest/google.cloud.storage.client.Client)`   
(Optional) The client to use. If not passed, falls back to the `client` stored on the blob's bucket.  
`credentials` |  ``google.auth.credentials.Credentials``   
(Optional) The authorization credentials to attach to requests. These credentials identify this application to the service. If none are specified, the client will attempt to ascertain the credentials from the environment.  
`version` |  `str`   
(Optional) The version of signed credential to create. Must be one of 'v2' 'v4'.  
`service_account_email` |  `str`   
(Optional) E-mail address of the service account.  
`access_token` |  `str`   
(Optional) Access token for a service account.  
`virtual_hosted_style` |  `bool`   
(Optional) If true, then construct the URL relative the bucket's virtual hostname, e.g., '  
`bucket_bound_hostname` |  `str`   
(Optional) If passed, then construct the URL relative to the bucket-bound hostname. Value can be a bare or with scheme, e.g., 'example.com' or '<http://example.com>'. Incompatible with api_access_endpoint and virtual_hosted_style. See: <https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/request-endpoints#cname>  
`scheme` |  `str`   
(Optional) If `bucket_bound_hostname` is passed as a bare hostname, use this value as the scheme. `https` will work only when using a CDN. Defaults to `"http"`.  
**Exceptions**  
---  
**Type** | **Description**  
``ValueError` | when version is invalid or mutually exclusive arguments are used.  
``TypeError` | when expiration is not a valid type.  
``AttributeError` | if credentials is not an instance of `google.auth.credentials.Signing`.  
**Returns**  
---  
**Type** | **Description**  
`str` | A signed URL you can use to access the resource until expiration.  
  
### get_iam_policy

        requested_policy_version=None,
        timeout=60,
        retry=google.api_core.retry.retry_unary.Retry,
    )

Retrieve the IAM policy for the object.

**Note:** Blob- / object-level IAM support does not yet exist and methods currently call an internal ACL backend not providing any utility beyond the blob's `acl` at this time. The API may be enhanced in the future and is currently undocumented. Use `acl` for managing object access control. 

**Parameters**

**Name** | **Description**  
`client` |  `[Client](https://docs.cloud.google.com/python/docs/reference/storage/latest/google.cloud.storage.client.Client)`   
(Optional) The client to use. If not passed, falls back to the `client` stored on the current object's bucket.  
`requested_policy_version` |  `int or `NoneType``   
(Optional) The version of IAM policies to request. If a policy with a condition is requested without setting this, the server will return an error. This must be set to a value of 3 to retrieve IAM policies containing conditions. This is to prevent client code that isn't aware of IAM conditions from interpreting and modifying policies incorrectly. The service might return a policy with version lower than the one that was requested, based on the feature syntax in the policy fetched.  
`timeout` |  `float or tuple`   
(Optional) The amount of time, in seconds, to wait for the server response. See: `configuring_timeouts`  
`retry` |  `google.api_core.retry.Retry or [google.cloud.storage.retry.ConditionalRetryPolicy](https://docs.cloud.google.com/python/docs/reference/storage/latest/google.cloud.storage.retry.ConditionalRetryPolicy)`   
(Optional) How to retry the RPC. See: `configuring_retries`  
**Returns**  
---  
**Type** | **Description**  
``google.api_core.iam.Policy`` | the policy instance, based on the resource returned from the `getIamPolicy` API request.

### open
    
    
    open(
        mode="r",

        ignore_flush=None,
        encoding=None,
        errors=None,
        newline=None,
        **kwargs
    )

Create a file handler for file-like I/O to or from this blob.

This method can be used as a context manager, just like Python's built-in 'open()' function.

While reading, as with other read methods, if blob.generation is not set the most recent blob generation will be used. Because the file-like IO reader downloads progressively in chunks, this could result in data from multiple versions being mixed together. If this is a concern, use either bucket.get_blob(), or blob.reload(), which will download the latest generation number and set it; or, if the generation is known, set it manually, for instance with bucket.blob(generation=123456).

Checksumming (hashing) to verify data integrity is disabled for reads using this feature because reads are implemented using request ranges, which do not provide checksums to validate. See <https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/hashes-etags> for details.

See a [code sample](https://github.com/googleapis/python-storage/blob/main/samples/snippets/storage_fileio_write_read.py).

Keyword arguments to pass to the underlying API calls. For both uploads and downloads, the following arguments are supported:

  * `if_generation_match`
  * `if_generation_not_match`
  * `if_metageneration_match`
  * `if_metageneration_not_match`
  * `timeout`
  * `retry`



For downloads only, the following additional arguments are supported:

  * `raw_download`
  * `single_shot_download`



For uploads only, the following additional arguments are supported:

  * `content_type`
  * `predefined_acl`
  * `checksum`



**Parameters**  
---  
**Name** | **Description**  
`mode` |  `str`   
(Optional) A mode string, as per standard Python `open()` semantics.The first character must be 'r', to open the blob for reading, or 'w' to open it for writing. The second character, if present, must be 't' for (unicode) text mode, or 'b' for bytes mode. If the second character is omitted, text mode is the default.  
`chunk_size` |  `long`   
(Optional) For reads, the minimum number of bytes to read at a time. If fewer bytes than the chunk_size are requested, the remainder is buffered. For writes, the maximum number of bytes to buffer before sending data to the server, and the size of each request when data is sent. Writes are implemented as a "resumable upload", so chunk_size for writes must be exactly a multiple of 256KiB as with other resumable uploads. The default is 40 MiB.  
`ignore_flush` |  `bool`   
(Optional) For non text-mode writes, makes flush() do nothing instead of raising an error. flush() without closing is not supported by the remote service and therefore calling it normally results in io.UnsupportedOperation. However, that behavior is incompatible with some consumers and wrappers of file objects in Python, such as zipfile.ZipFile or io.TextIOWrapper. Setting ignore_flush will cause flush() to successfully do nothing, for compatibility with those contexts. The correct way to actually flush data to the remote server is to close() (using a context manager, such as in the example, will cause this to happen automatically).  
`encoding` |  `str`   
(Optional) For text mode only, the name of the encoding that the stream will be decoded or encoded with. If omitted, it defaults to locale.getpreferredencoding(False).  
`errors` |  `str`   
(Optional) For text mode only, an optional string that specifies how encoding and decoding errors are to be handled. Pass 'strict' to raise a ValueError exception if there is an encoding error (the default of None has the same effect), or pass 'ignore' to ignore errors. (Note that ignoring encoding errors can lead to data loss.) Other more rarely-used options are also available; see the Python 'io' module documentation for 'io.TextIOWrapper' for a complete list.  
`newline` |  `str`   
(Optional) For text mode only, controls how line endings are handled. It can be None, '', '\n', '\r', and '\r\n'. If None, reads use "universal newline mode" and writes use the system default. See the Python 'io' module documentation for 'io.TextIOWrapper' for details.

Update blob's storage class via a rewrite-in-place. This helper will wait for the rewrite to complete before returning, so it may take some time for large files.

See <https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/per-object-storage-class>

If `user_project` is set on the bucket, bills the API request to that project.

**Parameters**  
---  
**Name** | **Description**  
`new_class` |  `str`   
new storage class for the object. One of: NEARLINE_STORAGE_CLASS, COLDLINE_STORAGE_CLASS, ARCHIVE_STORAGE_CLASS, STANDARD_STORAGE_CLASS, MULTI_REGIONAL_LEGACY_STORAGE_CLASS, or REGIONAL_LEGACY_STORAGE_CLASS.  
`client` |  `[Client](https://docs.cloud.google.com/python/docs/reference/storage/latest/google.cloud.storage.client.Client)`   
(Optional) The client to use. If not passed, falls back to the `client` stored on the blob's bucket.

`if_generation_not_match` |  `long`   
(Optional) See :ref:`using-if-generation-not-match` Note that the generation to be matched is that of the `destination` blob.  
`if_metageneration_match` |  `long`   
(Optional) See :ref:`using-if-metageneration-match` Note that the metageneration to be matched is that of the `destination` blob.  
`if_metageneration_not_match` |  `long`   
(Optional) See :ref:`using-if-metageneration-not-match` Note that the metageneration to be matched is that of the `destination` blob.  
`if_source_generation_match` |  `long`   
(Optional) Makes the operation conditional on whether the source object's generation matches the given value.  
`if_source_generation_not_match` |  `long`

(Optional) How to retry the RPC. The default value is `DEFAULT_RETRY_IF_GENERATION_SPECIFIED`, a conditional retry policy which will only enable retries if `if_generation_match` or `generation` is set, in order to ensure requests are idempotent before retrying them. Change the value to `DEFAULT_RETRY` or another `google.api_core.retry.Retry` object to enable retries regardless of generation precondition setting.

### upload_from_file
    
    
    upload_from_file(
        file_obj,
        rewind=False,
        size=None,
        content_type=None,
        client=None,

        checksum="auto",
        retry=google.api_core.retry.retry_unary.Retry,
        crc32c_checksum_value=None,
    )

Upload the contents of this blob from a file-like object.

The content type of the upload will be determined in order of precedence:

  * The value passed in to this method (if not :data:`None`)
  * The value stored on the current blob
  * The default value ('application/octet-stream')



**Note:** The effect of uploading to an existing blob depends on the "versioning" and "lifecycle" policies defined on the blob's bucket. In the absence of those policies, upload will overwrite any existing contents.  See the [`object versioning`](https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/object-versioning) and [`lifecycle`](https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/lifecycle) API documents for details.

If the size of the data to be uploaded exceeds 8 MB a resumable media request will be used, otherwise the content and the metadata will be uploaded in a single multipart upload request.

For more fine-grained over the upload process, check out [`google-resumable-media`](https://googleapis.dev/python/google-resumable-media/latest/index.html).

If `user_project` is set on the bucket, bills the API request to that project.

**Parameters**  
---  
**Name** | **Description**  
`file_obj` |  `file`   
A file handle opened in binary mode for reading.  
`rewind` |  `bool`   
If True, seek to the beginning of the file handle before writing the file to Cloud Storage.  
`size` |  `int`   
The number of bytes to be uploaded (which will be read from `file_obj`). If not provided, the upload will be concluded once `file_obj` is exhausted.  
`content_type` |  `str`   
(Optional) Type of content being uploaded.  
`client` |  `[Client](https://docs.cloud.google.com/python/docs/reference/storage/latest/google.cloud.storage.client.Client)`   
(Optional) The client to use. If not passed, falls back to the `client` stored on the blob's bucket.  
`predefined_acl` |  `str`   
(Optional) Predefined access control list  
`if_generation_match` |  `long`   
(Optional) See :ref:`using-if-generation-match`  
`if_generation_not_match` |  `long`   
(Optional) See :ref:`using-if-generation-not-match`  
`if_metageneration_match` |  `long`   
(Optional) See :ref:`using-if-metageneration-match`  
`if_metageneration_not_match` |  `long`   
(Optional) See :ref:`using-if-metageneration-not-match`  
`timeout` |  `float or tuple`   
(Optional) The amount of time, in seconds, to wait for the server response. See: `configuring_timeouts`  
`checksum` |  `str`   
(Optional) The type of checksum to compute to verify the integrity of the object. If the upload is completed in a single request, the checksum will be entirely precomputed and the remote server will handle verification and error handling. If the upload is too large and must be transmitted in multiple requests, the checksum will be incrementally computed and the client will handle verification and error handling, raising [google.cloud.storage.exceptions.DataCorruption](https://docs.cloud.google.com/python/docs/reference/storage/latest/google.cloud.storage.exceptions.DataCorruption) on a mismatch and attempting to delete the corrupted file. Supported values are "md5", "crc32c", "auto" and None. The default is "auto", which will try to detect if the C extension for crc32c is installed and fall back to md5 otherwise.  
`retry` |  `google.api_core.retry.Retry or [google.cloud.storage.retry.ConditionalRetryPolicy](https://docs.cloud.google.com/python/docs/reference/storage/latest/google.cloud.storage.retry.ConditionalRetryPolicy)`   
(Optional) How to retry the RPC. A None value will disable retries. A google.api_core.retry.Retry value will enable retries, and the object will define retriable response codes and errors and configure backoff and timeout options. A [google.cloud.storage.retry.ConditionalRetryPolicy](https://docs.cloud.google.com/python/docs/reference/storage/latest/google.cloud.storage.retry.ConditionalRetryPolicy) value wraps a Retry object and activates it only if certain conditions are met. This class exists to provide safe defaults for RPC calls that are not technically safe to retry normally (due to potential data duplication or other side-effects) but become safe to retry if a condition such as if_generation_match is set. See the retry.py source code and docstrings in this package ([google.cloud.storage.retry](https://docs.cloud.google.com/python/docs/reference/storage/latest/google.cloud.storage.retry)) for information on retry types and how to configure them.  
`crc32c_checksum_value` |  `str`   
(Optional) This should be the checksum of the entire contents of `file_obj`. Applicable while uploading object greater than `_MAX_MULTIPART_SIZE` bytes. It can be obtained by running `gcloud storage hash /path/to/your/file` or .. code-block:: python import google_crc32c import base64 data = b"Hello, world!" crc32c_int = google_crc32c.value(data) crc32c_hex = f"{crc32c_int:08x}" crc32c_bytes = crc32c_int.to_bytes(4, "big") base64_encoded = base64.b64encode(crc32c_bytes) crc32c_base64 = base64_encoded.decode("utf-8") print(crc32c_base64) Above code block prints 8 char string of base64 encoded big-endian bytes of 32 bit CRC32c integer. More details on CRC32c can be found in Appendix B: <https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc4960#appendix-B> and base64: <https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc4648#section-4>  
**Exceptions**  
---  
**Type** | **Description**  
`GoogleCloudError` | if the upload response returns an error status.
