    Document(mapping=None, *, ignore_unknown_fields=False, **kwargs)

A Firestore document.

Must not exceed 1 MiB - 4 bytes.

## Attributes  
  
---  
**Name** | **Description**  
`name` |  `str`   
The resource name of the document, for example `projects/{project_id}/databases/{database_id}/documents/{document_path}`.   
`fields` |  `MutableMapping[str, [google.cloud.firestore_v1.types.Value](https://docs.cloud.google.com/python/docs/reference/firestore/latest/google.cloud.firestore_v1.types.Value)]`   
The document's fields. The map keys represent field names. Field names matching the regular expression `__.*__` are reserved. Reserved field names are forbidden except in certain documented contexts. The field names, represented as UTF-8, must not exceed 1,500 bytes and cannot be empty. Field paths may be used in other contexts to refer to structured fields defined here. For `map_value`, the field path is represented by a dot-delimited (`.`) string of segments. Each segment is either a simple field name (defined below) or a quoted field name. For example, the structured field `"foo" : { map_value: { "x&y" : { string_value: "hello" }}}` would be represented by the field path :literal:`foo.`x&y\\`. A simple field name contains only characters `a` to `z`, `A` to `Z`, `0` to `9`, or `_`, and must not start with `0` to `9`. For example, `foo_bar_17`. A quoted field name starts and ends with :literal:`\` and may contain any character. Some characters, including :literal:`\`, must be escaped using a `\`. For example, :literal:`\`x&y\` represents `x&y` and :literal:`\`bak\\\`tik\` represents :literal:`bak`tik`.   
`create_time` |  `google.protobuf.timestamp_pb2.Timestamp`   
Output only. The time at which the document was created. This value increases monotonically when a document is deleted then recreated. It can also be compared to values from other documents and the `read_time` of a query.   
`update_time` |  `google.protobuf.timestamp_pb2.Timestamp`   
Output only. The time at which the document was last changed. This value is initially set to the `create_time` then increases monotonically with each change to the document. It can also be compared to values from other documents and the `read_time` of a query.   
  
## Classes 

### FieldsEntry
    
    
    FieldsEntry(mapping=None, *, ignore_unknown_fields=False, **kwargs)

The abstract base class for a message.

**Parameters**  
---  
**Name** | **Description**  
`kwargs` |  `dict`   
Keys and values corresponding to the fields of the message.  
`mapping` |  `Union[dict, `.Message`]`   
A dictionary or message to be used to determine the values for this message.  
`ignore_unknown_fields` |  `Optional(bool)`   
If True, do not raise errors for unknown fields. Only applied if `mapping` is a mapping type or there are keyword parameters.
