**Name** | **Description**  
`path` |  `Tuple[str, ...]`   
The components in the collection path. This is a series of strings representing each collection and sub-collection ID, as well as the document IDs for any documents that contain a sub-collection.  
`kwargs` |  `dict`   
The keyword arguments for the constructor. The only supported keyword is `client` and it must be a [Client](https://docs.cloud.google.com/python/docs/reference/firestore/latest/google.cloud.firestore_v1.client.Client) if provided. It represents the client that created this collection reference.  
**Exceptions**  
---
