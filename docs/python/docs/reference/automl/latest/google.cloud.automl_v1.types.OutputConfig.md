  * For Translation: CSV file `translation.csv`, with each line in format: ML_USE,GCS_FILE_PATH GCS_FILE_PATH leads to a .TSV file which describes examples that have given ML_USE, using the following row format per line: TEXT_SNIPPET (in source language) \t TEXT_SNIPPET (in target language)

    * For Tables: Output depends on whether the dataset was imported from Google Cloud Storage or BigQuery. Google Cloud Storage case: gcs_destination must be set. Exported are CSV file(s) `tables_1.csv`, `tables_2.csv`,...,\ `tables_N.csv` with each having as header line the table's column names, and all other lines contain values for the header columns. BigQuery case: bigquery_destination pointing to a BigQuery project must be set. In the given project a new dataset will be created with name `export_data_<automl-dataset-display-name>_<timestamp-of-export-call>` where will be made BigQuery-dataset-name compatible (e.g. most special characters will become underscores), and timestamp will be in YYYY_MM_DDThh_mm_ss_sssZ "based on ISO-8601" format. In that dataset a new table called `primary_table` will be created, and filled with precisely the same data as this obtained on import.

`gcs_destination` |  `[google.cloud.automl_v1.types.GcsDestination](https://docs.cloud.google.com/python/docs/reference/automl/latest/google.cloud.automl_v1.types.GcsDestination)`   
Required. The Google Cloud Storage location where the output is to be written to. For Image Object Detection, Text Extraction, Video Classification and Tables, in the given directory a new directory will be created with name: export_data-- where timestamp is in YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ss.sssZ ISO-8601 format. All export output will be written into that directory. This field is a member of `oneof`_ `destination`.
