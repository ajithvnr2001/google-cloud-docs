Lists information about the supported locations for this service.

This method lists locations based on the resource scope provided in the `[ListLocationsRequest.name](https://docs.cloud.google.com/apigee/docs/reference/apis/apihub/rest/v1/projects.locations/list#body.PATH_PARAMETERS.name)` field:

  * **Global locations** : If `name` is empty, the method lists the public locations available to all projects.
  * **Project-specific locations** : If `name` follows the format `projects/{project}`, the method lists locations visible to that specific project. This includes public, private, or other project-specific locations enabled for the project.



For gRPC and client library implementations, the resource name is passed as the `name` field. For direct service calls, the resource name is incorporated into the request path based on the specific service implementation and version.

### HTTP request

`GET https://apihub.googleapis.com/v1/{name=projects/*}/locations`

The URL uses [gRPC Transcoding](https://google.aip.dev/127) syntax.

### Path parameters

Parameters  
---  
`name` |  `string` The resource that owns the locations collection, if applicable.  
  
### Query parameters

Parameters  
---  
`filter` |  `string` A filter to narrow down results to a preferred subset. The filtering language accepts strings like `"displayName=tokyo"`, and is documented in more detail in [AIP-160](https://google.aip.dev/160).  
`pageSize` |  `integer` The maximum number of results to return. If not set, the service selects a default.  
`pageToken` |  `string` A page token received from the `nextPageToken` field in the response. Send that page token to receive the subsequent page.  
`extraLocationTypes[]` |  `string` Optional. Do not use this field unless explicitly documented otherwise. This is primarily for internal usage.  
  
### Request body

The request body must be empty.

### Response body

The response message for `[Locations.ListLocations](https://docs.cloud.google.com/apigee/docs/reference/apis/apihub/rest/v1/projects.locations/list#google.cloud.location.Locations.ListLocations)`.

If successful, the response body contains data with the following structure:

        }
      ],
      "nextPageToken": string
    }  
  
Fields  
---  
`locations[]` |  `object (`[Location](https://docs.cloud.google.com/apigee/docs/reference/apis/apihub/rest/v1/projects.locations#Location)`)` A list of locations that matches the specified filter in the request.  
`nextPageToken` |  `string` The standard List next-page token.
