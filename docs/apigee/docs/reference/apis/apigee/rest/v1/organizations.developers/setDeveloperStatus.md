Sets the status of a developer.

A developer is `active` by default. If you set a developer's status to `inactive`, the API keys assigned to the developer apps are no longer valid even though the API keys are set to `approved`. Inactive developers can still sign in to the developer portal and create apps; however, any new API keys generated during app creation won't work.

To set the status of a developer, set the `action` query parameter to `active` or `inactive`, and the `Content-Type` header to `application/octet-stream`. If successful, the API call returns the following HTTP status code: `204 No Content`
