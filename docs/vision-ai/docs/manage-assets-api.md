#  Manage media assets Stay organized with collections  Save and categorize content based on your preferences. 

The Vision Warehouse API allows you to manage Vision Warehouse resources using the command line.

A connected warehouse (`corpus`) in a data-ingesting deployed app has one or more media objects (for example, video resources). These media objects (`asset` resources) contain metadata and resource annotations. Use the following commands to manage these media objects.

## Create an asset resource

### REST

To create an asset resource, send a POST request by using the [`projects.locations.corpora.assets.create`](https://docs.cloud.google.com/vision-ai/docs/reference/rest/v1/projects.locations.corpora.assets/create) method.

Before using any of the request data, make the following replacements: 

  * REGIONALIZED_ENDPOINT: Endpoint might include a prefix matching the `LOCATION_ID` such as `europe-west4-`. See more about [ regionalized endpoints](https://docs.cloud.google.com/vision-ai/docs/warehouse-supported-regions). 
  * PROJECT_NUMBER: Your Google Cloud [project number](https://docs.cloud.google.com/resource-manager/docs/creating-managing-projects#identifying_projects). 
  * LOCATION_ID: The [region](https://cloud.google.com/about/locations) where you are using Agent Platform Vision. For example: `us-central1`, `europe-west4`. See [available regions](https://docs.cloud.google.com/vision-ai/docs/warehouse-supported-regions). 
  * CORPUS_ID: The ID of your target corpus.
  * ASSET_ID: (Optional) A user-provided value for the asset ID. In this request, the value is added to the request URL in the form: 
    * https://ENDPOINT/v1/[...]/corpora/CORPUS_ID/assets**?asset_id= ASSET_ID**
  * TIME_TO_LIVE: The amount of time to live (TTL) for all assets under a corpus, or the TTL of a specific asset. For example, for a corpus with assets with a TTL of 100 days, provide the value `8640000` (seconds). 



HTTP method and URL: 
    
    
    POST https://warehouse-visionai.googleapis.com/v1/projects/PROJECT_NUMBER/locations/LOCATION_ID/corpora/CORPUS_ID/assets

The response is empty if there are no errors. At this point the asset doesn't appear if you call `GetAsset` or `ListAssets`. 

## Asset media data management

The media content for asset can be ingested into Vision Warehouse through different APIs.

### Streaming video asset

To manage media content for streaming video assets, see the instructions that follow.

#### Get a video clip asset using temporal partitions

After you have created a warehouse and stored video `asset` resources in the warehouse you can get specific video clips. You can send a [`ClipAssetRequest`](https://docs.cloud.google.com/vision-ai/docs/reference/rpc/google.cloud.visionai.v1#clipassetrequest) to get media data over a time range you define.

When sending a `ClipAssetRequest` you must define the following:

  * [`temporal_partition`](https://docs.cloud.google.com/vision-ai/docs/reference/rest/v1/projects.locations.corpora.assets.annotations#TemporalPartition) -The date range for the desired clips.



The following example considers a warehouse containing an asset with security camera footage for early September 2021 which has not exceeded its time-to-live (TTL).

To get a clip of the period ranging from **9/1/2021 2:51:59 GMT** to **9/1/2021 2:52:30 GMT** you first need to convert the start and end time to [google.protobuf.Timestamp](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/reference/java/com/google/protobuf/Timestamp), which is expressed in duration since [Unix epoch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_time). After you have converted start and finish times, you can send a request similar to the following:

### REST

To get details about a video clip, send a GET request by using the [projects.locations.corpora.assets.clip](https://docs.cloud.google.com/vision-ai/docs/reference/rest/v1/projects.locations.corpora.assets/clip) method.

Before using any of the request data, make the following replacements: 

  * REGIONALIZED_ENDPOINT: Endpoint might include a prefix matching the `LOCATION_ID` such as `europe-west4-`. See more about [ regionalized endpoints](https://docs.cloud.google.com/vision-ai/docs/warehouse-supported-regions). 
  * PROJECT_NUMBER: Your Google Cloud [project number](https://docs.cloud.google.com/resource-manager/docs/creating-managing-projects#identifying_projects). 
  * LOCATION_ID: The [region](https://cloud.google.com/about/locations) where you are using Agent Platform Vision. For example: `us-central1`, `europe-west4`. See [available regions](https://docs.cloud.google.com/vision-ai/docs/warehouse-supported-regions). 
  * CORPUS_ID: The ID of your target corpus.
  * ASSET_ID: The ID of your target asset.
  * START_TIME: Start time of the partition, expressed in duration since Unix epoch (for example, `1630464719`). 
  * END_TIME: End time of the partition, expressed in duration since Unix epoch (for example, `1630464750`). 



HTTP method and URL: 
    
    
    POST https://warehouse-visionai.googleapis.com/v1/projects/PROJECT_NUMBER/locations/LOCATION_ID/corpora/CORPUS_ID/assets/ASSET_ID:clip

**Note:** The following command assumes that you have logged in to the `gcloud` CLI with your user account by running [`gcloud init`](https://docs.cloud.google.com/sdk/gcloud/reference/init) or [`gcloud auth login`](https://docs.cloud.google.com/sdk/gcloud/reference/auth/login) , or by using [Cloud Shell](https://docs.cloud.google.com/shell/docs), which automatically logs you into the `gcloud` CLI . You can check the currently active account by running [`gcloud auth list`](https://docs.cloud.google.com/sdk/gcloud/reference/auth/list). 

Save the request body in a file named `request.json`, and execute the following command: 
    
    
    curl -X POST \  
         -H "Authorization: Bearer $(gcloud auth print-access-token)" \  
         -H "Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8" \  
         -d @request.json \  
         "https://warehouse-visionai.googleapis.com/v1/projects/PROJECT_NUMBER/locations/LOCATION_ID/corpora/CORPUS_ID/assets/ASSET_ID:clip"

#### PowerShell

**Note:** The following command assumes that you have logged in to the `gcloud` CLI with your user account by running [`gcloud init`](https://docs.cloud.google.com/sdk/gcloud/reference/init) or [`gcloud auth login`](https://docs.cloud.google.com/sdk/gcloud/reference/auth/login) . You can check the currently active account by running [`gcloud auth list`](https://docs.cloud.google.com/sdk/gcloud/reference/auth/list). 

Save the request body in a file named `request.json`, and execute the following command: 
    
    
    $cred = gcloud auth print-access-token  
    $headers = @{ "Authorization" = "Bearer $cred" }  
      
    Invoke-WebRequest `  
        -Method POST `  
        -Headers $headers `  
        -ContentType: "application/json; charset=utf-8" `  
        -InFile request.json `  
        -Uri "https://warehouse-visionai.googleapis.com/v1/projects/PROJECT_NUMBER/locations/LOCATION_ID/corpora/CORPUS_ID/assets/ASSET_ID:clip" | Select-Object -Expand Content

You should receive a JSON response similar to the following:
    
    
    {
      "time_indexed_uris" : {
        "temporal_partition" : {
          "start_time" : {
            "seconds": 1630464719
          },
          "end_time" : {
            "seconds": 1630464729
          }
        },
        "uri": "[...]"
      }
    }
    

A `time_indexed_uris` includes a URI with a link to the clip retrieved and a `temporal_partition` detailing the start time and end time of the clip. You can access the link provided in the `uri` field for up to 12 hours.

The clip returned will only display a short clip of the first content available after `start_time`, but _before_ `end_time`. This content may extend beyond the temporal bounds in the request. For example, in the sample request the clip returned only covers a 10 second clip that occurs _after_ `1630464719`, even though there may still be more content that occurs after `1630464729`, and _before_ the `end_time` (`1630464750`).

The clip returned can not be the exact length you requested. This behavior is expected and can be due to multiple reasons:

  * The time range requested exceeded the data size limit of 100MB.
  * The time range requested contains data which has exceeded its time-to-live (TTL).
  * The time range requested has no data.



#### Get video clip assets using HTTP livestreaming

After you have created a warehouse and ingested video data (warehouse `assets`) in the warehouse, you can request a URI to an [HTTP Live Streaming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_Live_Streaming) (HLS) video stream manifest for a series of specific segments of time. You can send a `GenerateHlsUriRequest` to get media data over a series of time ranges you define.

When you send a `GenerateHlsUriRequest` you must define the following:

  * `temporal_partitions` \- A collection of date ranges for the desired content you want to stream. The total duration should be less than 24h.



The following example uses a warehouse asset with security camera footage for September 2021 which has not exceeded its time-to-live (TTL). The sample request body specifies two video time periods:

  1. 9/1/2021 2:51:59 GMT to 9/1/2021 2:52:30 GMT
  2. 9/1/2021 4:59:00 GMT to 9/1/2021 5:05:30 GMT



You first need to convert the start and end times to a [google.protobuf.Timestamp](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/reference/java/com/google/protobuf/Timestamp) format, which is expressed in [duration since Unix epoch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_time). After you have converted these times to Unix times, you can send a request similar to the following:

### REST & CMD LINE

Before using any of the request data, make the following replacements: 

  * REGIONALIZED_ENDPOINT: Endpoint might include a prefix matching the `LOCATION_ID` such as `europe-west4-`. See more about [ regionalized endpoints](https://docs.cloud.google.com/vision-ai/docs/warehouse-supported-regions). 
  * PROJECT_NUMBER: Your Google Cloud [project number](https://docs.cloud.google.com/resource-manager/docs/creating-managing-projects#identifying_projects). 
  * LOCATION_ID: The [region](https://cloud.google.com/about/locations) where you are using Agent Platform Vision. For example: `us-central1`, `europe-west4`. See [available regions](https://docs.cloud.google.com/vision-ai/docs/warehouse-supported-regions). 
  * CORPUS_ID: The ID of your target corpus.
  * ASSET_ID: The ID of your target asset.
  * START_TIME: Start time of the partition, expressed in duration since Unix epoch (for example, `1630464719`). 
  * END_TIME: End time of the partition, expressed in duration since Unix epoch (for example, `1630464750`).

        -Uri "https://warehouse-visionai.googleapis.com/v1/projects/PROJECT_NUMBER/locations/LOCATION_ID/corpora/CORPUS_ID/assets/ASSET_ID:generateHlsUri" | Select-Object -Expand Content

The `uri` in the response has a link to download the HLS manifest corresponding to the requested times and each `temporal_partitions` details the start and end time of the clips included in the stream. The link provided in the `uri` field can be accessed for up to 12 hours. 

A response may include multiple `temporal_partitions` objects. Each `temporal_partitions` object represents an individual clip within the requested time range. Clips are broken up if the source media does not contain data for a time within the requested range, or if the request includes non-consecutive date ranges. In this example multiple `temporal_partitions` are returned because the request asked for data at two different times on 9/1/2021. 

The stream returned may not have the exact length you requested. This is expected and can be due to the following reasons: 

  * The time range requested contains data which has exceeded its time-to-live
  * The time range requested has no data

**Response:**
    
    
    {
      "uri": "[...]",

      }
    }
    

#### View livestream by HLS

You can access an [HTTP livestream](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_Live_Streaming) (HLS) of the content currently being ingested. 

Send a `GenerateHlsUriRequest` to get a URI to this HLS video stream manifest, which is updated as new content is ingested. The livestream has three minutes of previously shown content, stops when ingestion stops, and restarts for new content. When you send `GenerateHlsUriRequest`, define `live_view_enabled`. This is the option to exclusively show a livestream of the asset, with up to three minutes of backlog data. Set it to true.

You can send a request similar to the following:

You can use the ImportAssets API to import a batch of images and its annotations to the corpus.

The Cloud Storage file for the ImportAsset request needs to be in JSONL format. In the file, each line corresponds to one asset and will be converted into `InputImageAsset` proto. For example,
    
    
    {"gcsUri":"gs://test/test1.png","assetId":"asset1","annotations":[{"key":"title","value":{"strValue":"cat"}}]}
    {"gcsUri":"gs://test/test2.png","assetId":"asset2","annotations":[{"key":"title","value":{"strValue":"dog"}}]}
    {"gcsUri":"gs://test/test3.png","assetId":"asset3","annotations":[{"key":"title","value":{"strValue":"rabbit"}}]}
    

Only one ImportAsset operation can happen on a corpus at a given time. Only five ImportAsset operations can happen within the same project at the same time.
