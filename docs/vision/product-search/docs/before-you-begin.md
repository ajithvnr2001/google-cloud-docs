# Before you begin  |  Vision API Product Search  |  Google Cloud Documentation

The Product Search feature is in maintenance mode. For better scalability and the same functionality as Product Search, use the [Vision Warehouse](https://cloud.google.com/vision-ai/docs/warehouse-overview).

#  Before you begin Stay organized with collections  Save and categorize content based on your preferences. 

**Note:** Vision API Product Search is a Cloud Vision API feature. Consequently, you must enable the Vision API to use Vision API Product Search.

Before you can use the Cloud Vision API, you must enable it for your project:

  1. Sign in to your Google Cloud account. If you're new to Google Cloud, [ create an account](https://console.cloud.google.com/freetrial) to evaluate how our products perform in real-world scenarios. New customers also get $300 in free credits to run, test, and deploy workloads. 
  2. In the Google Cloud console, on the project selector page, select or create a Google Cloud project.

**Roles required to select or create a project**

     * **Select a project** : Selecting a project doesn't require a specific IAM role—you can select any project that you've been granted a role on. 
     * **Create a project** : To create a project, you need the Project Creator role (`roles/resourcemanager.projectCreator`), which contains the `resourcemanager.projects.create` permission. [Learn how to grant roles](https://docs.cloud.google.com/iam/docs/granting-changing-revoking-access). 
**Note** : If you don't plan to keep the resources that you create in this procedure, create a project instead of selecting an existing project. After you finish these steps, you can delete the project, removing all resources associated with the project.

[Go to project selector](https://console.cloud.google.com/projectselector2/home/dashboard)

  3. [Verify that billing is enabled for your Google Cloud project](https://docs.cloud.google.com/billing/docs/how-to/verify-billing-enabled#confirm_billing_is_enabled_on_a_project). 

  4. Enable the Vision API, if it is not already enabled. 

**Roles required to enable APIs**

To enable APIs, you need the `serviceusage.services.enable` permission. If you created the project, then you likely already have this permission through the Owner role (`roles/owner`). Otherwise, you can get this permission through the Service Usage Admin role (`roles/serviceusage.serviceUsageAdmin`). [Learn how to grant roles](https://docs.cloud.google.com/iam/docs/granting-changing-revoking-access). 

[Enable the API](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/enableflow?apiid=vision.googleapis.com)

  5. Create a service account: 

     1. Ensure that you have the Create Service Accounts IAM role (`roles/iam.serviceAccountCreator`) and the Project IAM Admin role (`roles/resourcemanager.projectIamAdmin`). [Learn how to grant roles](https://docs.cloud.google.com/iam/docs/granting-changing-revoking-access). 
     2. In the Google Cloud console, go to the **Create service account** page. 

[Go to Create service account](https://console.cloud.google.com/projectselector/iam-admin/serviceaccounts/create?supportedpurview=project)
     3. Select your project. 
     4. In the **Service account name** field, enter a name. The Google Cloud console fills in the **Service account ID** field based on this name. 

In the **Service account description** field, enter a description. For example, `Service account for quickstart`. 

     5. Click **Create and continue**. 
     6. Grant the **Project > Owner** role to the service account. 

To grant the role, find the **Select a role** list, then select **Project > Owner**. 

**Note** : The **Role** field affects which resources the service account can access in your project. You can revoke these roles or grant additional roles later. In production environments, do not grant the Owner, Editor, or Viewer roles. Instead, grant a [predefined role](https://docs.cloud.google.com/iam/docs/understanding-roles#predefined_roles) or [custom role](https://docs.cloud.google.com/iam/docs/understanding-custom-roles) that meets your needs. 
     7. Click **Continue**. 
     8. Click **Done** to finish creating the service account. 

Do not close your browser window. You will use it in the next step. 

  6. Create a service account key: 

     1. In the Google Cloud console, click the email address for the service account that you created. 
     2. Click **Keys**. 
     3. Click **Add key** , and then click **Create new key**. 
     4. Click **Create**. A JSON key file is downloaded to your computer. 
     5. Click **Close**. 
  7. Set the environment variable `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` to the path of the JSON file that contains your credentials. This variable applies only to your current shell session, so if you open a new session, set the variable again. 

**Example:** Linux or macOS
         
         export GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS="KEY_PATH"

Replace `KEY_PATH` with the path of the JSON file that contains your credentials.

For example:
         
         export GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS="/home/user/Downloads/service-account-file.json"

**Example:** Windows

For PowerShell:
         
         $env:GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS="KEY_PATH"

Replace `KEY_PATH` with the path of the JSON file that contains your credentials.

For example:
         
         $env:GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS="C:\Users\username\Downloads\service-account-file.json"

For command prompt:
         
         set GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS=KEY_PATH

Replace `KEY_PATH` with the path of the JSON file that contains your credentials.
