Fields  
---  
`name` |  `string` The resource that owns the locations collection, if applicable.  
`filter` |  `string` A filter to narrow down results to a preferred subset. The filtering language accepts strings like `"displayName=tokyo"`, and is documented in more detail in [AIP-160](https://google.aip.dev/160).  
`pageSize` |  `integer` The maximum number of results to return. If not set, the service selects a default.  
`pageToken` |  `string` A page token received from the `nextPageToken` field in the response. Send that page token to receive the subsequent page.  
`extraLocationTypes[]` |  `string` Optional. Do not use this field unless explicitly documented otherwise. This is primarily for internal usage.
