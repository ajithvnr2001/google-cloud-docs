#  Set up a Globalping data store Stay organized with collections  Save and categorize content based on your preferences. 

**Public preview:** The federated search is in public preview. This feature is subject to the "Pre-GA Offerings Terms" in the [General Service Terms section of the Service Specific Terms](https://cloud.google.com/terms/service-terms). Pre-GA features are available "as is" and might have limited support. For more information, see the [launch stage descriptions](https://cloud.google.com/products#product-launch-stages). 

This page describes how to create a data store and connect Globalping to Gemini Enterprise.

## Before you begin

Before you set up your Globalping connection, do the following:

  1. Grant the Discovery Engine Editor role (`roles/discoveryengine.editor`). This role is required for the user to create the data store. To grant this role, do the following: 
     1. In the Google Cloud console, go to the **IAM** page. 

[Go to IAM](https://console.cloud.google.com/iam-admin/iam)

     2. Locate the user account and click edit **Edit**.
     3. Grant the `Discovery Engine Editor` role to the user. For more information, see [IAM roles and permissions](https://cloud.google.com/gemini/enterprise/docs/access-control).



**Note:** Globalping uses Google-managed OAuth. You don't need to create your own OAuth application or provide a client ID and client secret. You authorize the connector with your Globalping account when you enable connector in app.

## Create the Globalping data store

To create the Globalping data store, perform the following steps:

  1. In the Google Cloud console, go to the Gemini Enterprise page.

[Gemini Enterprise](https://console.cloud.google.com/gemini-enterprise/)

  2. Select or [create](https://docs.cloud.google.com/resource-manager/docs/creating-managing-projects) a Google Cloud project.

  3. In the navigation menu, click **Data stores**.

  4. Click add**Create data store**.

  5. In the **Source** section, search for **Globalping** , and click **Select**.

  6. In the **Data** section:

     1. In the **Entities to search** section, choose which entities Gemini Enterprise should scan. For Globalping, select **Measurements**.
  7. Click **Continue**.

  8. If the create data store flow shows an **Advanced options** section, you can select the **Enable Static IP Addresses** checkbox within it. This ensures the data store uses a fixed set of IP addresses for outbound traffic, suitable for allowlisting on the source system. For more information, see [Configure static IP egress](https://docs.cloud.google.com/gemini/enterprise/docs/connectors/configure-static-ip-egress). 

  9. In the **Configuration** section: 

     1. From the **Multi-region** list, select the location for your data connector.
     2. In the **Your data connector name** field, enter a name for your connector.
     3. If you selected `us` or `eu` as the location, configure the **Encryption settings** : 
        * Optional: If you haven't configured single-region keys, click **Go to settings page** to do so. For more information, see [Register a single-region key for third-party connectors](https://docs.cloud.google.com/gemini/enterprise/docs/cmek#third-party-connectors-key-registration).
        * Select **Google-managed encryption key** or **Cloud KMS key**.
        * If you selected **Cloud KMS key** : 
          * In the **Key management type** list, select the appropriate type.
          * In the **Cloud KMS key** list, select the key.
For more information, see [Customer-managed encryption keys](https://docs.cloud.google.com/gemini/enterprise/docs/cmek). 
  10. Click **Continue**.

  11. In the **Billing** section, select **General pricing** or **Configurable pricing**. For more information, see [Verify the billing status of your projects](https://cloud.google.com/billing/docs/how-to/verify-billing-enabled) and [Licenses](https://docs.cloud.google.com/gemini/enterprise/docs/licenses). 

  12. Click **Create**. Gemini Enterprise creates your data store and displays your data stores on the **Data Stores** page.




On the **Data Stores** page, click your data store name to see the status. After the data store state changes from **Creating** to **Active** , the Globalping data store is ready to be used.

After creating the data store, connect the data store you just created to an existing app or [create a new app](https://docs.cloud.google.com/gemini/enterprise/docs/create-app) and [connect](https://docs.cloud.google.com/gemini/enterprise/docs/connect-existing-data-store) it to the new app, and [authorize](https://docs.cloud.google.com/gemini/enterprise/docs/connect-existing-data-store#user_authorization) Gemini Enterprise to access Globalping before executing any queries.

## Data handling and query execution

This section describes how Gemini Enterprise manages your query and the privacy implications of using the federated data store.

### Query execution

After you authorize Globalping and send a search query to Gemini Enterprise:

  * Gemini Enterprise sends your search query directly to the Globalping API.
  * Gemini Enterprise blends the results with those from other connected data sources and displays a comprehensive search result.



### Data handling

When using third-party federated search, the following data handling rules apply:

  * Your query string is sent to the third-party search backend (Globalping API).
  * These third parties may associate queries with your identity.
  * If multiple federated search data sources are enabled, the query might be sent to all of them.
  * After the data reaches the third-party system, it is governed by that system's terms of service and privacy policies.

**Note:** To improve accuracy, an LLM may rewrite your query before it is sent to Globalping. This rewritten query can incorporate information from your session's query history. As a result, parts of your query history might also be included in the query sent to the Globalping API.

## What's next

  * To provide a user interface for querying your Globalping data, [create an app](https://docs.cloud.google.com/gemini/enterprise/docs/create-app) and [connect it to the Globalping data store](https://docs.cloud.google.com/gemini/enterprise/docs/connect-existing-data-store).
  * To preview how your search results appear after your app is set up, see [Get search results](https://docs.cloud.google.com/gemini/enterprise/docs/preview-search-results).
  * To enable alerts for the data store, see [Configure alerts for third-party data stores](https://docs.cloud.google.com/gemini/enterprise/docs/configure-periodic-data-alerts).
