#  Overview Stay organized with collections  Save and categorize content based on your preferences. 

**Public preview:** The federated search is in public preview. This feature is subject to the "Pre-GA Offerings Terms" in the [General Service Terms section of the Service Specific Terms](https://cloud.google.com/terms/service-terms). Pre-GA features are available "as is" and might have limited support. For more information, see the [launch stage descriptions](https://cloud.google.com/products#product-launch-stages). 

The pg-aiguide data store for Gemini Enterprise lets you search Tiger Cloud, TimescaleDB, PostgreSQL, and PostGIS documentation and best-practice skills.

## Limitations

  * When creating a new app or adding a data store to an existing one, it's recommended to associate only one data store with actions belonging to a single connector type.


  * Enforcing a VPC Service Controls perimeter on existing pg-aiguide data stores is not supported. To enforce VPC Service Controls, you must delete and recreate the data stores. For more information on VPC Service Controls and how to use actions after enabling VPC Service Controls, see [Secure your app with VPC Service Controls](https://docs.cloud.google.com/gemini/enterprise/docs/use-vpc-service-controls).


  * The pg-aiguide data store is supported only in the `global`, `us`, and `eu` locations.


  * This connector does not require authentication (Public API).



## What's next

  * To create and configure a data store with pg-aiguide, see [Set up a pg-aiguide data store](https://docs.cloud.google.com/gemini/enterprise/docs/connectors/pg_aiguide/set-up-data-store).
