# Get catalog details  |  Lakehouse  |  Google Cloud Documentation

> Source: https://docs.cloud.google.com/lakehouse/docs/get-catalog-details/

As of April 20th, 2026, BigLake is now called Lakehouse. BigLake metastore is now called the Lakehouse runtime catalog. Lakehouse APIs, client libraries, CLI commands, and IAM names remain unchanged and still reference BigLake.

The Lakehouse runtime catalog lets you inspect the configuration and metadata of [catalog endpoints](https://docs.cloud.google.com/lakehouse/docs/about-lakehouse-catalogs#configuration) in borderless Lakehouse.

For Apache Iceberg REST catalog endpoints, you can retrieve the REST catalog URI required for client connections, the authentication method, and the associated service account.

## Before you begin

  1. Read [About the Lakehouse runtime catalog](https://docs.cloud.google.com/lakehouse/docs/about-lakehouse-catalogs) to understand how the Lakehouse runtime catalog works and the limitations for the service.

Sign in to your Google Cloud account. If you're new to Google Cloud, [ create an account](https://console.cloud.google.com/freetrial) to evaluate how our products perform in real-world scenarios. New customers also get $300 in free credits to run, test, and deploy workloads. 

In the Google Cloud console, on the project selector page, select or create a Google Cloud project.

**Roles required to select or create a project**

     * **Select a project** : Selecting a project doesn't require a specific IAM role—you can select any project that you've been granted a role on. 
     * **Create a project** : To create a project, you need the Project Creator role (`roles/resourcemanager.projectCreator`), which contains the `resourcemanager.projects.create` permission. [Learn how to grant roles](https://docs.cloud.google.com/iam/docs/granting-changing-revoking-access). 
**Note** : If you don't plan to keep the resources that you create in this procedure, create a project instead of selecting an existing project. After you finish these steps, you can delete the project, removing all resources associated with the project.

[Go to project selector](https://console.cloud.google.com/projectselector2/home/dashboard)

[Verify that billing is enabled for your Google Cloud project](https://docs.cloud.google.com/billing/docs/how-to/verify-billing-enabled#confirm_billing_is_enabled_on_a_project). 

Enable the BigLake API, if it is not already enabled. 

**Roles required to enable APIs**

To enable APIs, you need the `serviceusage.services.enable` permission. If you created the project, then you likely already have this permission through the Owner role (`roles/owner`). Otherwise, you can get this permission through the Service Usage Admin role (`roles/serviceusage.serviceUsageAdmin`). [Learn how to grant roles](https://docs.cloud.google.com/iam/docs/granting-changing-revoking-access).

### Required roles

To get the permissions that you need to view catalog details, ask your administrator to grant you the following IAM roles on your project: 

  * All: 
    * [BigLake Admin ](https://docs.cloud.google.com/iam/docs/roles-permissions/biglake#biglake.admin) (`roles/biglake.admin`)
    * [Storage Admin ](https://docs.cloud.google.com/iam/docs/roles-permissions/storage#storage.admin) (`roles/storage.admin`)



For more information about granting roles, see [Manage access to projects, folders, and organizations](https://docs.cloud.google.com/iam/docs/granting-changing-revoking-access). 

You might also be able to get the required permissions through [custom roles](https://docs.cloud.google.com/iam/docs/creating-custom-roles) or other [predefined roles](https://docs.cloud.google.com/iam/docs/roles-overview#predefined). 

## Get catalog details

Inspect catalog configuration and properties.

###  Console 

  1. In the Google Cloud console, open the **Lakehouse** page.

[Go to Lakehouse](https://console.cloud.google.com/biglake)

  2. Click the name of any catalog.

  3. On the **Catalog Details** page, explore information about the catalog such as catalog ID, creation timestamp, REST catalog URI, authentication method, and service account.




###  gcloud 

To describe a catalog using `gcloud`, run the [`gcloud biglake iceberg catalogs describe` command](https://docs.cloud.google.com/sdk/gcloud/reference/biglake/iceberg/catalogs/describe).
    
    
    gcloud biglake iceberg catalogs describe CATALOG_ID \
        --project="PROJECT_ID"

Replace the following:

  * `CATALOG_ID`: the ID of your catalog.
  * `PROJECT_ID`: your Google Cloud project ID.



###  REST 

To retrieve catalog details and configuration using the REST API, make a `GET` request to the [`GetIcebergCatalog`](https://docs.cloud.google.com/lakehouse/docs/reference/rest/v1/iceberg.v1.restcatalog.extensions.projects.catalogs/get) endpoint:
    
    
    GET /iceberg/v1/restcatalog/extensions/projects/PROJECT_ID/catalogs/CATALOG_ID
    

The response contains an `IcebergCatalog` JSON object describing the catalog configuration.

Replace the following:

  * `PROJECT_ID`: your Google Cloud project ID.
  * `CATALOG_ID`: the ID of your catalog.
