# Authenticating to the Video Intelligence API  |  Google Cloud Documentation

> Source: https://docs.cloud.google.com/video-intelligence/docs/common/auth/

Starting on September 14, 2026, Video Intelligence API is officially deprecated and will no longer be supported. You can continue using Video Intelligence API until September 14, 2027, when it will be shut down. We recommend migrating to [Gemini family of models](https://docs.cloud.google.com/gemini-enterprise-agent-platform/models/google-models).

#  Authenticating to the Video Intelligence API Stay organized with collections  Save and categorize content based on your preferences. 

This page describes what a service account is, how to create one to authenticate requests to the Video Intelligence API, and how to use your service account to set [Application Default Credentials](https://docs.cloud.google.com/accounts/docs/application-default-credentials). 

To allow your application code to use the Video Intelligence API, you must set up the proper credentials for your application to _authenticate_ its identity to the service and to obtain _authorization_ to perform tasks. (These credential-related mechanisms are known as _auth_ schemes.)

**Note:** Authentication and authorization are large topics. How you set up your application or service depends on a variety of factors, including who, or what application, you want to authenticate, what tasks you want to allow the authenticated entity to perform (commonly referred to as authorization), and what, if any, container you use—for example, Compute Engine or App Engine. See the [Google Cloud Platform Auth Guide](https://docs.cloud.google.com/docs/authentication) for more information. 

Google Cloud API authentication and authorization (commonly grouped together as "auth") is typically done using a service account. A service account allows your code to send application credentials directly to the Video Intelligence API. A service account, like a user account, is represented by an email address. Unlike a user account, a service account is associated only with an application.

## Enabling the API

Before you can authenticate, you must first enable the Video Intelligence API.

  1. Sign in to your Google Cloud account. If you're new to Google Cloud, [ create an account](https://console.cloud.google.com/freetrial) to evaluate how our products perform in real-world scenarios. New customers also get $300 in free credits to run, test, and deploy workloads. 
  2. In the Google Cloud console, on the project selector page, select or create a Google Cloud project.

**Roles required to select or create a project**

     * **Select a project** : Selecting a project doesn't require a specific IAM role—you can select any project that you've been granted a role on. 
     * **Create a project** : To create a project, you need the Project Creator role (`roles/resourcemanager.projectCreator`), which contains the `resourcemanager.projects.create` permission. [Learn how to grant roles](https://docs.cloud.google.com/iam/docs/granting-changing-revoking-access). 
**Note** : If you don't plan to keep the resources that you create in this procedure, create a project instead of selecting an existing project. After you finish these steps, you can delete the project, removing all resources associated with the project.

[Go to project selector](https://console.cloud.google.com/projectselector2/home/dashboard)

  3. [Verify that billing is enabled for your Google Cloud project](https://docs.cloud.google.com/billing/docs/how-to/verify-billing-enabled#confirm_billing_is_enabled_on_a_project). 

  4. Enable the Cloud Video Intelligence API, if it is not already enabled. 

**Roles required to enable APIs**

To enable APIs, you need the `serviceusage.services.enable` permission. If you created the project, then you likely already have this permission through the Owner role (`roles/owner`). Otherwise, you can get this permission through the Service Usage Admin role (`roles/serviceusage.serviceUsageAdmin`). [Learn how to grant roles](https://docs.cloud.google.com/iam/docs/granting-changing-revoking-access). 

[Enable the API](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/enableflow?apiid=videointelligence.googleapis.com)

  5. Create a service account: 

     1. Ensure that you have the Create Service Accounts IAM role (`roles/iam.serviceAccountCreator`) and the Project IAM Admin role (`roles/resourcemanager.projectIamAdmin`). [Learn how to grant roles](https://docs.cloud.google.com/iam/docs/granting-changing-revoking-access). 
     2. In the Google Cloud console, go to the **Create service account** page. 

[Go to Create service account](https://console.cloud.google.com/projectselector/iam-admin/serviceaccounts/create?supportedpurview=project)
     3. Select your project. 
     4. In the **Service account name** field, enter a name. The Google Cloud console fills in the **Service account ID** field based on this name. 

In the **Service account description** field, enter a description. For example, `Service account for quickstart`. 

     5. Click **Create and continue**. 
     6. Click **Done** to finish creating the service account. 

Do not close your browser window. You will use it in the next step. 

  6. Create a service account key: 

     1. In the Google Cloud console, click the email address for the service account that you created. 
     2. Click **Keys**. 
     3. Click **Add key** , and then click **Create new key**. 
     4. Click **Create**. A JSON key file is downloaded to your computer. 
     5. Click **Close**. 
  7. Set the environment variable `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` to the path of the JSON file that contains your credentials. This variable applies only to your current shell session, so if you open a new session, set the variable again. 

**Example:** Linux or macOS
         
         export GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS="KEY_PATH"

Replace `KEY_PATH` with the path of the JSON file that contains your credentials.

For example:
         
         export GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS="/home/user/Downloads/service-account-file.json"

**Example:** Windows

For PowerShell:
         
         $env:GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS="KEY_PATH"

Replace `KEY_PATH` with the path of the JSON file that contains your credentials.

For example:
         
         $env:GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS="C:\Users\username\Downloads\service-account-file.json"

For command prompt:
         
         set GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS=KEY_PATH

Replace `KEY_PATH` with the path of the JSON file that contains your credentials.

  8. [Install](https://docs.cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/install) the Google Cloud CLI. 

  9. If you're using an external identity provider (IdP), you must first [ sign in to the gcloud CLI with your federated identity](https://docs.cloud.google.com/iam/docs/workforce-log-in-gcloud). 

  10. To [initialize](https://docs.cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/initializing) the gcloud CLI, run the following command: 
         
         gcloud init

  11. In the Google Cloud console, on the project selector page, select or create a Google Cloud project.

**Roles required to select or create a project**

     * **Select a project** : Selecting a project doesn't require a specific IAM role—you can select any project that you've been granted a role on.

## Creating a service account in the Google Cloud console

To create a service account using the Google Cloud console, do the following:

  1. From the Google Cloud console [Credentials](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials) page, select **Create credentials > Service account key**.

![](https://docs.cloud.google.com/static/video-intelligence/docs/images/credentials-service-account.png)
  2. Next, under **Service account** select **New service account**.

![](https://docs.cloud.google.com/static/video-intelligence/docs/images/new-service-account.png)
  3. In the **Service account name** box, enter a name for your service account. This name is used as the default name for your **Service account ID** (to the left of the "@" in the generated service account ID address), but you can change this service account ID name. These names are arbitrary; it is only important that you remember them.

  4. Under **Key type** select **JSON** for most new projects.

  5. Click **Create**.




The Google Cloud console then generates a JSON key (as a `.json` text file), prompts you to download the file to your computer, and displays a **Service account created** dialog box.

![](https://docs.cloud.google.com/static/video-intelligence/docs/images/downloaded-json.png)

The generated JSON key will be similar to the following sample JSON key:
    
    
    {
      "type": "service_account",
      "project_id": "PROJECT_ID",
      "private_key_id": "SOME_NUMBER",
      "private_key": "-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----\nPRIVATE_KEY\n-----END PRIVATE KEY-----\n",
      "client_email": "SERVICE_ACCOUNT_EMAIL",
      "client_id": "...",
      "auth_uri": "https://accounts.google.com/o/oauth2/auth",
      "token_uri": "https://accounts.google.com/o/oauth2/token",
      "auth_provider_x509_cert_url": "https://www.googleapis.com/oauth2/v1/certs",
      "client_x509_cert_url": "https://www.googleapis.com/robot/v1/metadata/x509/SERVICE_ACCOUNT_EMAIL"
    }
    

Store this JSON file securely, as it contains your private key (and this file is the only copy of that key). You must refer to this service account key file within your code when you send annotation requests to Video Intelligence API.

## Authenticating with Application Default Credentials

The simplest way for applications to authenticate to Video Intelligence API is by using [Application Default Credentials](https://docs.cloud.google.com/accounts/docs/application-default-credentials) (ADC). Services using ADC first search for credentials within a `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` environment variable. Unless you specifically require ADC to use other credentials (for example, user credentials), you should set this environment variable to point to your service account key file (the `.json` file downloaded when you created a service account key.
    
    
    $ export GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS=PATH_TO_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_FILE
