#  Encrypt Cloud Speech-to-Text resources Stay organized with collections  Save and categorize content based on your preferences. 

This page demonstrates how to set an encryption key in Cloud Speech-to-Text to encrypt Speech-to-Text resources.

Speech-to-Text lets you provide [Cloud Key Management Service](https://docs.cloud.google.com/security-key-management) encryption keys and encrypts data with the provided key. To learn more about encryption, see [Introduction to encryption](https://docs.cloud.google.com/speech-to-text/docs/encryption).

## Before you begin

  1. Sign in to your Google Cloud account. If you're new to Google Cloud, [ create an account](https://console.cloud.google.com/freetrial) to evaluate how our products perform in real-world scenarios. New customers also get $300 in free credits to run, test, and deploy workloads. 
  2. In the Google Cloud console, on the project selector page, select or create a Google Cloud project.

**Roles required to select or create a project**

     * **Select a project** : Selecting a project doesn't require a specific IAM role—you can select any project that you've been granted a role on. 
     * **Create a project** : To create a project, you need the Project Creator role (`roles/resourcemanager.projectCreator`), which contains the `resourcemanager.projects.create` permission. [Learn how to grant roles](https://docs.cloud.google.com/iam/docs/granting-changing-revoking-access). 
**Note** : If you don't plan to keep the resources that you create in this procedure, create a project instead of selecting an existing project. After you finish these steps, you can delete the project, removing all resources associated with the project.

[Go to project selector](https://console.cloud.google.com/projectselector2/home/dashboard)

  3. [Verify that billing is enabled for your Google Cloud project](https://docs.cloud.google.com/billing/docs/how-to/verify-billing-enabled#confirm_billing_is_enabled_on_a_project). 

  4. Enable the Speech-to-Text APIs, if any are not already enabled. 

**Roles required to enable APIs**

To enable APIs, you need the `serviceusage.services.enable` permission. If you created the project, then you likely already have this permission through the Owner role (`roles/owner`). Otherwise, you can get this permission through the Service Usage Admin role (`roles/serviceusage.serviceUsageAdmin`). [Learn how to grant roles](https://docs.cloud.google.com/iam/docs/granting-changing-revoking-access). 

[Enable the APIs](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/enableflow?apiid=speech.googleapis.com,)

  5. Make sure that you have the following role or roles on the project: Cloud Speech Administrator 

#### Check for the roles

     1. In the Google Cloud console, go to the **IAM** page. 

[Go to IAM](https://console.cloud.google.com/projectselector/iam-admin/iam?supportedpurview=project)
     2. Select the project. 
     3. In the **Principal** column, find all rows that identify you or a group that you're included in. To learn which groups you're included in, contact your administrator. 

     4. For all rows that specify or include you, check the **Role** column to see whether the list of roles includes the required roles. 

#### Grant the roles

     1. In the Google Cloud console, go to the **IAM** page. 

[Go to IAM](https://console.cloud.google.com/projectselector/iam-admin/iam?supportedpurview=project)
     2. Select the project. 
     3. Click person_add **Grant access**. 
     4. In the **New principals** field, enter your user identifier. This is typically the email address for a Google Account.

     5. Click **Select a role** , then search for the role. 
     6. To grant additional roles, click add **Add another role** and add each additional role. 
     7. Click **Save**. 
  6. [Install](https://docs.cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/install) the Google Cloud CLI. 

**Note:** If you installed the gcloud CLI previously, make sure you have the latest version by running `gcloud components update`. 
  7. If you're using an external identity provider (IdP), you must first [ sign in to the gcloud CLI with your federated identity](https://docs.cloud.google.com/iam/docs/workforce-log-in-gcloud). 

  8. To [initialize](https://docs.cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/initializing) the gcloud CLI, run the following command: 
         
         gcloud init

  9. In the Google Cloud console, on the project selector page, select or create a Google Cloud project.

**Roles required to select or create a project**

     * **Select a project** : Selecting a project doesn't require a specific IAM role—you can select any project that you've been granted a role on. 
     * **Create a project** : To create a project, you need the Project Creator role (`roles/resourcemanager.projectCreator`), which contains the `resourcemanager.projects.create` permission. [Learn how to grant roles](https://docs.cloud.google.com/iam/docs/granting-changing-revoking-access).

  14. If you're using an external identity provider (IdP), you must first [ sign in to the gcloud CLI with your federated identity](https://docs.cloud.google.com/iam/docs/workforce-log-in-gcloud). 

  15. To [initialize](https://docs.cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/initializing) the gcloud CLI, run the following command: 
         
         gcloud init

Client libraries can use [Application Default Credentials](https://docs.cloud.google.com/docs/authentication/application-default-credentials) to easily authenticate with Google APIs and send requests to those APIs. With Application Default Credentials, you can test your application locally and deploy it without changing the underlying code. For more information, see [ Authenticate for using client libraries](https://docs.cloud.google.com/docs/authentication/client-libraries).

  16. If you're using a local shell, then create local authentication credentials for your user account: 
         
         gcloud auth application-default login

You don't need to do this if you're using Cloud Shell.

If an authentication error is returned, and you are using an external identity provider (IdP), confirm that you have [ signed in to the gcloud CLI with your federated identity](https://docs.cloud.google.com/iam/docs/workforce-log-in-gcloud). 




Also ensure you have [installed the client library](https://docs.cloud.google.com/speech-to-text/docs/libraries).

## Enable access to Cloud Key Management Service keys

Cloud Speech-to-Text uses a service account to access your Cloud KMS keys. By default, the service account has no access to Cloud KMS keys.

The service account email address is the following:
    
    
    service-PROJECT_NUMBER@gcp-sa-speech.iam.gserviceaccount.com
    

To encrypt Speech-to-Text resources using Cloud KMS keys, you can give this service account the `roles/cloudkms.cryptoKeyEncrypterDecrypter` role:
    
    
    gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding PROJECT_NUMBER \
        --member=serviceAccount:service-PROJECT_NUMBER@gcp-sa-speech.iam.gserviceaccount.com \
        --role=roles/cloudkms.cryptoKeyEncrypterDecrypter

More information about project Identity and Access Management (IAM) policy is available at [Manage access to projects, folders, and organizations](https://docs.cloud.google.com/iam/docs/granting-changing-revoking-access).

More information about managing access to Cloud Storage is available at [Create and Manage access control lists](https://docs.cloud.google.com/storage/docs/access-control/create-manage-lists) in the Cloud Storage documentation.

## Specify an encryption key

Here is an example of providing an encryption key to Cloud Speech-to-Text using the [`Config`](https://docs.cloud.google.com/speech-to-text/docs/reference/rpc/google.cloud.speech.v2#config) resource:

### Python
    
    
    import os
    
    from google.cloud.speech_v2 import SpeechClient
    from google.cloud.speech_v2.types import cloud_speech
    
    PROJECT_ID = os.getenv("GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT")
    
    
    def enable_cmek(
        kms_key_name: str,
    ) -> cloud_speech.Config:
        """Enable Customer-Managed Encryption Keys (CMEK) in a project and region.
        Args:
            kms_key_name (str): The full resource name of the KMS key to be used for encryption.
                E.g,: projects/{PROJECT_ID}/locations/{LOCATION}/keyRings/{KEY_RING}/cryptoKeys/{KEY_NAME}
        Returns:
            cloud_speech.Config: The response from the update configuration request,
            containing the updated configuration details.
        """
        # Instantiates a client
        client = SpeechClient()
    
        request = cloud_speech.UpdateConfigRequest(
            config=cloud_speech.Config(
                name=f"projects/{PROJECT_ID}/locations/global/config",
                kms_key_name=kms_key_name,
            ),
            update_mask={"paths": ["kms_key_name"]},
        )
    
        # Updates the KMS key for the project and region.
        response = client.update_config(request=request)
    
        print(f"Updated KMS key: {response.kms_key_name}")
        return response
    
    

When an encryption key is specified in the `Config` resource of your project, any new resources created in the corresponding location are encrypted using this key. See [Introduction to encryption](https://docs.cloud.google.com/speech-to-text/docs/encryption) page for more information on what is encrypted and when.

Encrypted resources have the `kms_key_name` and `kms_key_version_name` fields populated in Speech-to-Text API responses.

## Remove encryption

To prevent future resources from being encrypted with an encryption key, use the code above and provide the empty string (`""`) as the key in the request. This ensures that new resources aren't encrypted. This command doesn't decrypt existing resources.

## Key rotation and deletion

On key rotation, resources that are encrypted with a previous version of the Cloud KMS key remain encrypted with that version. Any resources created after the key rotation are encrypted with the new default version of the key. Any resources updated (using `Update*` methods) after the key rotation are re-encrypted with the new default version of the key.

On key deletion, Speech-to-Text can't decrypt your data and can't create resources or access resources encrypted with the deleted key. Likewise, when you revoke Speech-to-Text permission for a key, Speech-to-Text can't decrypt your data and can't create resources or access resources encrypted with the Speech-to-Text permission-revoked key.

## Re-encrypt data

To re-encrypt your resources, you can call the corresponding `Update*` method for each resource after updating the key specification in the `Config` resource.

## Clean up

To avoid incurring charges to your Google Cloud account for the resources used on this page, follow these steps.

  1. Optional: Revoke the authentication credentials that you created, and delete the local credential file. 
         
         gcloud auth application-default revoke

  2. Optional: Revoke credentials from the gcloud CLI. 
         
         gcloud auth revoke




### Console

**Caution** : Deleting a project has the following effects: 

  * **Everything in the project is deleted.** If you used an existing project for the tasks in this document, when you delete it, you also delete any other work you've done in the project. 
  * **Custom project IDs are lost.** When you created this project, you might have created a custom project ID that you want to use in the future. To preserve the URLs that use the project ID, such as an `appspot.com` URL, delete selected resources inside the project instead of deleting the whole project. 



If you plan to explore multiple architectures, tutorials, or quickstarts, reusing projects can help you avoid exceeding project quota limits. 

* In the Google Cloud console, go to the **Manage resources** page. 

[Go to Manage resources](https://console.cloud.google.com/iam-admin/projects)

* In the project list, select the project that you want to delete, and then click **Delete**. 
* In the dialog, type the project ID, and then click **Shut down** to delete the project.
