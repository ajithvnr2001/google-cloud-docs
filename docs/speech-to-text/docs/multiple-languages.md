**Preview**

This feature is subject to the "Pre-GA Offerings Terms" in the General Service Terms section of the [Service Specific Terms](https://docs.cloud.google.com/terms/service-terms#1). Pre-GA features are available "as is" and might have limited support. For more information, see the [launch stage descriptions](https://cloud.google.com/products/#product-launch-stages). 

This page describes how to set up a recognizer to automatically recognize the language spoken in an audio file, from a preset list of potential languages.

In some situations, you don't know for certain what language your audio recordings contain. For example, if you publish your service, app, or product in a country with multiple official languages, you can potentially receive audio input from users in a variety of languages. This can make specifying a single language code for transcription requests significantly more difficult.

## Multiple language recognition

Cloud Speech-to-Text offers a way for you to specify a set of languages that your audio data might contain. When creating a [`Recognizer`](https://docs.cloud.google.com/speech-to-text/docs/recognizers) or sending a recognition request, you can provide one or more languages that the audio data might include in the [`language_codes`](https://docs.cloud.google.com/speech-to-text/docs/reference/rpc/google.cloud.speech.v2#google.cloud.speech.v2.Recognizer.FIELDS.repeated.string.google.cloud.speech.v2.Recognizer.language_codes) field. In a request with multiple languages, Cloud Speech-to-Text attempts to transcribe the audio using the best-fit language from the list of alternates you provided. Cloud Speech-to-Text then labels the transcription results with the predicted language code.

This feature is ideal for apps that need to transcribe short statements like voice commands or search. You can list up to three languages for automatic language recognition.

**Caution:** Though you can specify up to three languages, constrain the language list to the bare minimum needed as a best practice. The fewer language codes you specify, the higher the likelihood that Cloud Speech-to-Text successfully selects the correct one.**Note:** Specifying multiple languages is only available in the Cloud Speech-to-Text `global` region and the `us` and `eu` multi-regions.**Note:** You can only use the alternative languages feature with the `long`, `short`, and `telephony` models. For more information about how to specify different models, see the [models](https://docs.cloud.google.com/speech-to-text/docs/transcription-model) documentation.

## Before you begin

  1. Sign in to your Google Cloud account. If you're new to Google Cloud, [ create an account](https://console.cloud.google.com/freetrial) to evaluate how our products perform in real-world scenarios. New customers also get $300 in free credits to run, test, and deploy workloads. 
  2. In the Google Cloud console, on the project selector page, select or create a Google Cloud project.

**Roles required to select or create a project**

     * **Select a project** : Selecting a project doesn't require a specific IAM role—you can select any project that you've been granted a role on. 
     * **Create a project** : To create a project, you need the Project Creator role (`roles/resourcemanager.projectCreator`), which contains the `resourcemanager.projects.create` permission. [Learn how to grant roles](https://docs.cloud.google.com/iam/docs/granting-changing-revoking-access). 
**Note** : If you don't plan to keep the resources that you create in this procedure, create a project instead of selecting an existing project. After you finish these steps, you can delete the project, removing all resources associated with the project.

[Go to project selector](https://console.cloud.google.com/projectselector2/home/dashboard)

  3. [Verify that billing is enabled for your Google Cloud project](https://docs.cloud.google.com/billing/docs/how-to/verify-billing-enabled#confirm_billing_is_enabled_on_a_project). 

  4. Enable the Speech-to-Text APIs, if any are not already enabled. 

**Roles required to enable APIs**

To enable APIs, you need the `serviceusage.services.enable` permission. If you created the project, then you likely already have this permission through the Owner role (`roles/owner`). Otherwise, you can get this permission through the Service Usage Admin role (`roles/serviceusage.serviceUsageAdmin`). [Learn how to grant roles](https://docs.cloud.google.com/iam/docs/granting-changing-revoking-access). 

[Enable the APIs](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/enableflow?apiid=speech.googleapis.com,)

  5. Make sure that you have the following role or roles on the project: Cloud Speech Administrator 

#### Check for the roles

     1. In the Google Cloud console, go to the **IAM** page. 

[Go to IAM](https://console.cloud.google.com/projectselector/iam-admin/iam?supportedpurview=project)
     2. Select the project. 
     3. In the **Principal** column, find all rows that identify you or a group that you're included in. To learn which groups you're included in, contact your administrator. 

     4. For all rows that specify or include you, check the **Role** column to see whether the list of roles includes the required roles. 

#### Grant the roles

     1. In the Google Cloud console, go to the **IAM** page. 

[Go to IAM](https://console.cloud.google.com/projectselector/iam-admin/iam?supportedpurview=project)
     2. Select the project. 
     3. Click person_add **Grant access**. 
     4. In the **New principals** field, enter your user identifier. This is typically the email address for a Google Account.

     5. Click **Select a role** , then search for the role. 
     6. To grant additional roles, click add **Add another role** and add each additional role. 
     7. Click **Save**. 
  6. [Install](https://docs.cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/install) the Google Cloud CLI. 

**Note:** If you installed the gcloud CLI previously, make sure you have the latest version by running `gcloud components update`. 
  7. If you're using an external identity provider (IdP), you must first [ sign in to the gcloud CLI with your federated identity](https://docs.cloud.google.com/iam/docs/workforce-log-in-gcloud). 

  8. To [initialize](https://docs.cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/initializing) the gcloud CLI, run the following command: 
         
         gcloud init

  9. In the Google Cloud console, on the project selector page, select or create a Google Cloud project.

  15. To [initialize](https://docs.cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/initializing) the gcloud CLI, run the following command: 
         
         gcloud init

Client libraries can use [Application Default Credentials](https://docs.cloud.google.com/docs/authentication/application-default-credentials) to easily authenticate with Google APIs and send requests to those APIs. With Application Default Credentials, you can test your application locally and deploy it without changing the underlying code. For more information, see [ Authenticate for using client libraries](https://docs.cloud.google.com/docs/authentication/client-libraries).

  16. If you're using a local shell, then create local authentication credentials for your user account: 
         
         gcloud auth application-default login

You don't need to do this if you're using Cloud Shell.

If an authentication error is returned, and you are using an external identity provider (IdP), confirm that you have [ signed in to the gcloud CLI with your federated identity](https://docs.cloud.google.com/iam/docs/workforce-log-in-gcloud). 




Also ensure you have [installed the client library](https://docs.cloud.google.com/speech-to-text/docs/libraries).

## Enable language recognition in audio transcription requests

Here is an example of performing synchronous speech recognition on a local audio file with multiple languages.

### Python
    
    
    import os
    
    from typing import List
    
    from google.cloud.speech_v2 import SpeechClient

    PROJECT_ID = os.getenv("GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT")
    
    
    def transcribe_multiple_languages_v2(
        audio_file: str,
        language_codes: List[str],
    ) -> cloud_speech.RecognizeResponse:
        """Transcribe an audio file using Google Cloud Speech-to-Text API with support for multiple languages.
        Args:

                transcription results.
        """
        client = SpeechClient()
    
        # Reads a file as bytes
        with open(audio_file, "rb") as f:
            audio_content = f.read()
    
        config = cloud_speech.RecognitionConfig(
            auto_decoding_config=cloud_speech.[AutoDetectDecodingConfig](https://docs.cloud.google.com/python/docs/reference/speech/latest/google.cloud.speech_v2.types.AutoDetectDecodingConfig.html)(),
            language_codes=language_codes,
            model="latest_long",
        )
    
        request = cloud_speech.RecognizeRequest(
            recognizer=f"projects/{PROJECT_ID}/locations/global/recognizers/_",
            config=config,
            content=audio_content,
        )
    
        # Transcribes the audio into text
        response = client.[recognize](https://docs.cloud.google.com/python/docs/reference/speech/latest/google.cloud.speech_v1.services.speech.SpeechClient.html#google_cloud_speech_v1_services_speech_SpeechClient_recognize)(request=request)
        # Prints the transcription results
        for result in response.results:
            print(f"Transcript: {result.alternatives[0].transcript}")
    
        return response
    
    

## Clean up

To avoid incurring charges to your Google Cloud account for the resources used on this page, follow these steps.

  1. Optional: Revoke the authentication credentials that you created, and delete the local credential file. 
         
         gcloud auth application-default revoke

  2. Optional: Revoke credentials from the gcloud CLI. 
         
         gcloud auth revoke




### Console

**Caution** : Deleting a project has the following effects: 

  * **Everything in the project is deleted.** If you used an existing project for the tasks in this document, when you delete it, you also delete any other work you've done in the project. 
  * **Custom project IDs are lost.** When you created this project, you might have created a custom project ID that you want to use in the future. To preserve the URLs that use the project ID, such as an `appspot.com` URL, delete selected resources inside the project instead of deleting the whole project. 



If you plan to explore multiple architectures, tutorials, or quickstarts, reusing projects can help you avoid exceeding project quota limits. 

* In the Google Cloud console, go to the **Manage resources** page. 

[Go to Manage resources](https://console.cloud.google.com/iam-admin/projects)

* In the project list, select the project that you want to delete, and then click **Delete**. 
* In the dialog, type the project ID, and then click **Shut down** to delete the project.
