Signaling function termination in Node

## Code sample

### Node.js

To authenticate to Cloud Run functions, set up Application Default Credentials. For more information, see [Set up authentication for a local development environment](https://docs.cloud.google.com/docs/authentication/set-up-adc-local-dev-environment). 
    
    
    // Await-ing promises within functions is OK if you don't return anything
    await Promise.resolve();
    
    // These will cause background tasks to stop executing immediately
    return 1; // OK: returning a value
    
    // These will wait until the related background task finishes
    return Promise.resolve(); // OK: returning the promise itself
    return await Promise.resolve(); // Same as above
    return Promise.reject(); // OK: same behavior as to-be-resolved promises
    return await Promise.reject(); // Same as above
