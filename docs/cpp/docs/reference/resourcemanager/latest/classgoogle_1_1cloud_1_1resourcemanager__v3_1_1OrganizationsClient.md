Allows users to manage their organization resources. 

###### Equality

Instances of this class created via copy-construction or copy-assignment always compare equal. Instances created with equal `std::shared_ptr<*Connection>` objects compare equal. Objects that compare equal share the same underlying resources.

###### Performance

Creating a new instance of this class is a relatively expensive operation, new objects establish new connections to the service. In contrast, copy-construction, move-construction, and the corresponding assignment operations are relatively efficient as the copies share all underlying resources.

###### Thread Safety

Concurrent access to different instances of this class, even if they compare equal, is guaranteed to work. Two or more threads operating on the same instance of this class is not guaranteed to work. Since copy-construction and move-construction is a relatively efficient operation, consider using such a copy when using this class from multiple threads.

**Parameters**  
---  
**Name** | **Description**  
`name` |  `std::string const &`   
Required. The resource name of the Organization to fetch. This is the organization's relative path in the API, formatted as "organizations/[organizationId]". For example, "organizations/1234".

**Type** | **Description**  
`StatusOr< google::cloud::resourcemanager::v3::Organization >` | the result of the RPC. The response message type ([google.cloud.resourcemanager.v3.Organization](https://github.com/googleapis/googleapis/blob/28769825ec5fa31815f172b0de490a84e74cb97a/google/cloud/resourcemanager/v3/organizations.proto#L112)) is mapped to a C++ class using the [Protobuf mapping rules](https://protobuf.dev/reference/cpp/cpp-generated/). If the request fails, the [`StatusOr`](https://docs.cloud.google.com/cpp/docs/reference/common/latest/classgoogle_1_1cloud_1_1StatusOr.html) contains the error details.   
  
### GetOrganization(google::cloud::resourcemanager::v3::GetOrganizationRequest const &, Options)

Fetches an organization resource identified by the specified resource name. 

**Parameters**  
---  
**Name** | **Description**  
`request` |  `google::cloud::resourcemanager::v3::GetOrganizationRequest const &`   
Unary RPCs, such as the one wrapped by this function, receive a single `request` proto message which includes all the inputs for the RPC. In this case, the proto message is a [google.cloud.resourcemanager.v3.GetOrganizationRequest](https://github.com/googleapis/googleapis/blob/28769825ec5fa31815f172b0de490a84e74cb97a/google/cloud/resourcemanager/v3/organizations.proto#L176). Proto messages are converted to C++ classes by Protobuf, using the [Protobuf mapping rules](https://protobuf.dev/reference/cpp/cpp-generated/).   
`opts` |  `Options`   
Optional. Override the class-level options, such as retry and backoff policies.   
**Returns**  
---  
**Type** | **Description**  
`StatusOr< google::cloud::resourcemanager::v3::Organization >` | the result of the RPC.

If the request fails, the [`StatusOr`](https://docs.cloud.google.com/cpp/docs/reference/common/latest/classgoogle_1_1cloud_1_1StatusOr.html) contains the error details.   
  
### SearchOrganizations(std::string const &, Options)

Searches organization resources that are visible to the user and satisfy the specified filter. 

This method returns organizations in an unspecified order. New organizations do not necessarily appear at the end of the results, and may take a small amount of time to appear.

Search will only return organizations on which the user has the permission `resourcemanager.organizations.get`

**Parameters**  
---  
**Name** | **Description**  
`query` |  `std::string const &`   
Optional. An optional query string used to filter the Organizations to return in the response. Query rules are case-insensitive.

    |------------------|--------------------------------------------|
    | directoryCustomerId, owner.directoryCustomerId | Filters by directory
    customer id. |
    | domain           | Filters by domain.                         |
    ```<br>
     Organizations may be queried by `directoryCustomerId` or by `domain`, where the domain is a G Suite domain, for example: <br>
    - Query `directorycustomerid:123456789` returns Organization resources with `owner.directory_customer_id` equal to `123456789`.
    - Query `domain:google.com` returns Organization resources corresponding to the domain `google.com`.

See the documentation of this type for details. In brief, this class has `begin()` and `end()` member functions returning a iterator class meeting the [input iterator requirements](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/named_req/InputIterator). The value type for this iterator is a [`StatusOr`](https://docs.cloud.google.com/cpp/docs/reference/common/latest/classgoogle_1_1cloud_1_1StatusOr.html) as the iteration may fail even after some values are retrieved successfully, for example, if there is a network disconnect.
