This topic shows how to send a few simple requests to the Cloud Billing API.

For a full list of methods, see the [REST](https://docs.cloud.google.com/billing/reference/rest) or [RPC](https://docs.cloud.google.com/billing/reference/rpc) reference documentation.

## Before you begin

  1. Sign in to your Google Cloud account. If you're new to Google Cloud, [ create an account](https://console.cloud.google.com/freetrial) to evaluate how our products perform in real-world scenarios. New customers also get $300 in free credits to run, test, and deploy workloads. 
  2. In the Google Cloud console, on the project selector page, select or create a Google Cloud project.

**Roles required to select or create a project**

     * **Select a project** : Selecting a project doesn't require a specific IAM role—you can select any project that you've been granted a role on. 
     * **Create a project** : To create a project, you need the Project Creator role (`roles/resourcemanager.projectCreator`), which contains the `resourcemanager.projects.create` permission. [Learn how to grant roles](https://docs.cloud.google.com/iam/docs/granting-changing-revoking-access). 
**Note** : If you don't plan to keep the resources that you create in this procedure, create a project instead of selecting an existing project. After you finish these steps, you can delete the project, removing all resources associated with the project.

[Go to project selector](https://console.cloud.google.com/projectselector2/home/dashboard)

  3. [Verify that billing is enabled for your Google Cloud project](https://docs.cloud.google.com/billing/docs/how-to/verify-billing-enabled#confirm_billing_is_enabled_on_a_project). 

  4. Enable the Cloud Billing API, if it is not already enabled. 

**Roles required to enable APIs**

To enable APIs, you need the `serviceusage.services.enable` permission. If you created the project, then you likely already have this permission through the Owner role (`roles/owner`). Otherwise, you can get this permission through the Service Usage Admin role (`roles/serviceusage.serviceUsageAdmin`). [Learn how to grant roles](https://docs.cloud.google.com/iam/docs/granting-changing-revoking-access). 

[Enable the API](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/enableflow?apiid=cloudbilling.googleapis.com)

  5. Create a service account: 

     1. Ensure that you have the Create Service Accounts IAM role (`roles/iam.serviceAccountCreator`) and the Project IAM Admin role (`roles/resourcemanager.projectIamAdmin`). [Learn how to grant roles](https://docs.cloud.google.com/iam/docs/granting-changing-revoking-access). 
     2. In the Google Cloud console, go to the **Create service account** page. 

[Go to Create service account](https://console.cloud.google.com/projectselector/iam-admin/serviceaccounts/create?supportedpurview=project)
     3. Select your project. 
     4. In the **Service account name** field, enter a name. The Google Cloud console fills in the **Service account ID** field based on this name. 

In the **Service account description** field, enter a description. For example, `Service account for quickstart`. 

     5. Click **Create and continue**. 
     6. Grant the **Project > Owner** role to the service account. 

To grant the role, find the **Select a role** list, then select **Project > Owner**. 

**Note** : The **Role** field affects which resources the service account can access in your project. You can revoke these roles or grant additional roles later. In production environments, do not grant the Owner, Editor, or Viewer roles. Instead, grant a [predefined role](https://docs.cloud.google.com/iam/docs/understanding-roles#predefined_roles) or [custom role](https://docs.cloud.google.com/iam/docs/understanding-custom-roles) that meets your needs. 
     7. Click **Continue**. 
     8. Click **Done** to finish creating the service account. 

Do not close your browser window. You will use it in the next step. 

  6. Create a service account key: 

     1. In the Google Cloud console, click the email address for the service account that you created. 
     2. Click **Keys**. 
     3. Click **Add key** , and then click **Create new key**. 
     4. Click **Create**. A JSON key file is downloaded to your computer. 
     5. Click **Close**. 
  7. Set the environment variable `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` to the path of the JSON file that contains your credentials. This variable applies only to your current shell session, so if you open a new session, set the variable again. 

**Example:** Linux or macOS
         
         export GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS="KEY_PATH"

Replace `KEY_PATH` with the path of the JSON file that contains your credentials.

For example:
         
         export GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS="/home/user/Downloads/service-account-file.json"

**Example:** Windows

For PowerShell:
         
         $env:GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS="KEY_PATH"

Replace `KEY_PATH` with the path of the JSON file that contains your credentials.

For example:
         
         $env:GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS="C:\Users\username\Downloads\service-account-file.json"

For command prompt:
         
         set GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS=KEY_PATH

Replace `KEY_PATH` with the path of the JSON file that contains your credentials.

  8. In the Google Cloud console, on the project selector page, select or create a Google Cloud project.

**Roles required to select or create a project**

     * **Select a project** : Selecting a project doesn't require a specific IAM role—you can select any project that you've been granted a role on. 
     * **Create a project** : To create a project, you need the Project Creator role (`roles/resourcemanager.projectCreator`), which contains the `resourcemanager.projects.create` permission. [Learn how to grant roles](https://docs.cloud.google.com/iam/docs/granting-changing-revoking-access).

## Get a list of Cloud Billing Accounts

The API method to list all Cloud Billing Accounts ([REST](https://docs.cloud.google.com/billing/reference/rest/v1/billingAccounts/list), [RPC](https://docs.cloud.google.com/billing/reference/rpc/google.cloud.billing.v1#google.cloud.billing.v1.CloudBilling.google.cloud.billing.v1.CloudBilling.ListBillingAccounts)) is the simpest method in the API, as it has no required parameters, so it's a good place to start. The method simply returns all billing accounts that you have permission to view.

## Protocol
    
    
    GET https://cloudbilling.googleapis.com/v1/billingAccounts

## Java
    
    
        ListBillingAccountsResponse result = service.billingAccounts().list().execute();

## Retrieve a particular Cloud Billing Account

To retrieve a particular billing account ([REST](https://docs.cloud.google.com/billing/reference/rest/v1/billingAccounts/get), [RPC](https://docs.cloud.google.com/billing/reference/rpc/google.cloud.billing.v1#google.cloud.billing.v1.CloudBilling.google.cloud.billing.v1.CloudBilling.GetBillingAccount)), you'll need to know the billing account ID. This example uses the sample ID `012345-567890-ABCDEF`.

## Protocol
    
    
    GET https://cloudbilling.googleapis.com/v1/billingAccounts/012345-567890-ABCDEF

## Java
    
    
        BillingAccount result = service.billingAccounts()
            .get("billingAccounts/00C5EA-61187E-D842F2").execute();

## Enable Cloud Billing on a Google Cloud project

To enable Cloud Billing on a Google Cloud project, you need to call the Cloud Billing API to associate the Google Cloud project with an existing Cloud Billing Account ([REST](https://docs.cloud.google.com/billing/reference/rest/v1/projects/updateBillingInfo), [RPC](https://docs.cloud.google.com/billing/reference/rpc/google.cloud.billing.v1#google.cloud.billing.v1.CloudBilling.google.cloud.billing.v1.CloudBilling.UpdateProjectBillingInfo)). The following sample code associates Google Cloud project `tokyo-rain-123` with Cloud Billing Account `012345-567890-ABCDEF`. Incidentally, the same API method can be used to disable Cloud Billing on a Google Cloud project, by setting `billingAccountName` to empty.

## Protocol
    
    
    PUT https://cloudbilling.googleapis.com/v1/projects/tokyo-rain-123/billingInfo
    
    {
      "billingAccountName": "billingAccounts/012345-567890-ABCDEF"
    }

## Java
    
    
        service.projects().updateBillingInfo(
                "projects/tokyo-rain-123",
                new ProjectBillingInfo().setBillingAccountName("billingAccounts/012345-567890-ABCDEF"))
            .execute();

## Clean up

**Caution** : Deleting a project has the following effects: 
     * **Everything in the project is deleted.** If you used an existing project for the tasks in this document, when you delete it, you also delete any other work you've done in the project. 
     * **Custom project IDs are lost.** When you created this project, you might have created a custom project ID that you want to use in the future. To preserve the URLs that use the project ID, such as an `appspot.com` URL, delete selected resources inside the project instead of deleting the whole project. 

If you plan to explore multiple architectures, tutorials, or quickstarts, reusing projects can help you avoid exceeding project quota limits. 

  1. In the Google Cloud console, go to the **Manage resources** page. 

[Go to Manage resources](https://console.cloud.google.com/iam-admin/projects)

  2. In the project list, select the project that you want to delete, and then click **Delete**. 
  3. In the dialog, type the project ID, and then click **Shut down** to delete the project.
