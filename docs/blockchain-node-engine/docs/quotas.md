#  Quotas and limits Stay organized with collections  Save and categorize content based on your preferences. 

This document lists the quotas and system limits that apply to Blockchain Node Engine.

  * _Quotas_ have default values, but you can typically request adjustments.
  * _System limits_ are fixed values that can't be changed.



Google Cloud uses quotas to help ensure fairness and reduce spikes in resource use and availability. A quota restricts how much of a Google Cloud resource your Google Cloud project can use. Quotas apply to a range of resource types, including hardware, software, and network components. For example, quotas can restrict the number of API calls to a service, the number of load balancers used concurrently by your project, or the number of projects that you can create. Quotas protect the community of Google Cloud users by preventing the overloading of services. Quotas also help you to manage your own Google Cloud resources.

The Cloud Quotas system does the following:

  * Monitors your consumption of Google Cloud products and services
  * Restricts your consumption of those resources
  * Provides a way to [request changes to the quota value](https://docs.cloud.google.com/docs/quotas/help/request_increase) and [automate quota adjustments](https://docs.cloud.google.com/docs/quotas/quota-adjuster)



In most cases, when you attempt to consume more of a resource than its quota allows, the system blocks access to the resource, and the task that you're trying to perform fails.

Quotas generally apply at the Google Cloud project level. Your use of a resource in one project doesn't affect your available quota in another project. Within a Google Cloud project, quotas are shared across all applications and IP addresses. 

For more information, see the [Cloud Quotas overview](https://docs.cloud.google.com/docs/quotas/overview). 

There are also _system limits_ on Blockchain Node Engine resources. System limits can't be changed. 

## Allocation quotas

The following quotas don't reset over time and instead are released when you release the resource:

Quotas | Value  
---|---  
Blockchain nodes per project per location | 24  
Ethereum archive nodes per project per location | 12  
Ethereum full nodes per project per location | 16  
Polygon sentry archive nodes per project per location | 12  
Polygon sentry full nodes per project per location | 16  
  
## Rate quotas

The following quotas apply to Blockchain Node Engine requests:

Quota | Value  
---|---  
Blockchain node API per minute per project | 38,400  
Control plane API per minute per project | 240  
  
## Request a quota increase

To adjust most quotas, use the Google Cloud console. For more information, see [Request a quota adjustment](https://docs.cloud.google.com/docs/quotas/help/request_increase).
