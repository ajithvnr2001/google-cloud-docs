This document shows you how to use the data lineage remote Model Context Protocol (MCP) server to connect with AI applications including Gemini CLI, ChatGPT, Claude, and custom applications you are developing. The data lineage remote MCP server lets you interact with data lineage to query data lineage graphs, discover upstream data provenance, and analyze downstream impact. The Data Lineage API remote MCP server is enabled when you enable the Data Lineage API API. 

[Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs/getting-started/intro) (MCP) standardizes how large language models (LLMs) and AI applications or agents connect to external data sources. MCP servers let you use their tools, resources, and prompts to take actions and get updated data from their backend service.

## What's the difference between local and remote MCP servers?

Local MCP servers
    Typically run on your local machine and use the standard input and output streams (stdio) for communication between services on the same device.
Remote MCP servers
    Run on the service's infrastructure and offer an HTTP endpoint to AI applications for communication between the AI MCP client and the MCP server. For more information about MCP architecture, see [MCP architecture](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs/learn/architecture).

## Stateless core

With [MCP version 2026-07-28](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/2026-07-28), MCP changes from a bidirectional, stateful protocol to a stateless protocol. Each MCP request is self-describing and can be routed using headers. There isn't a need for the `initialize`/`initialized` handshake or `Mcp-Session-Id` because each request includes all the information needed in HTTP headers or the `_meta` parameter. MCP servers can request additional information required by a tool through [multi-round-trip requests (MRTR)](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/latest/basic/patterns/mrtr).

To help route and process requests without parsing the request body, some MCP headers are required, including the following:

  * Headers that are required by the MCP specification such as the [protocol version header](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/latest/basic/transports/streamable-http#protocol-version-header) and [standard request headers](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/latest/basic/transports/streamable-http#standard-request-headers).
  * [Custom headers](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/latest/basic/transports/streamable-http#custom-headers-from-tool-parameters) that are defined by the MCP server. These headers are mirrored into HTTP headers from the tool's input schema using the `x-mcp-header` property. For example, an MCP server might define a custom header to specify the Google Cloud region or project ID.



For more information about MCP architecture, see the MCP version 2026-07-28 [specification](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/2026-07-28) and [key changes](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/2026-07-28/changelog).

## Google and Google Cloud remote MCP servers

Google and Google Cloud remote MCP servers have the following features and benefits: 

  * Simplified, centralized discovery
  * Managed global or regional HTTP endpoints
  * Fine-grained authorization
  * Optional prompt and response security with Model Armor protection
  * Centralized audit logging



For information about other MCP servers and information about security and governance controls available for Google Cloud MCP servers, see [Google Cloud MCP servers overview](https://docs.cloud.google.com/mcp/overview).

## Before you begin

  1. Sign in to your Google Cloud account. If you're new to Google Cloud, [ create an account](https://console.cloud.google.com/freetrial) to evaluate how our products perform in real-world scenarios. New customers also get $300 in free credits to run, test, and deploy workloads. 
  2. In the Google Cloud console, on the project selector page, select or create a Google Cloud project.

**Roles required to select or create a project**

     * **Select a project** : Selecting a project doesn't require a specific IAM role—you can select any project that you've been granted a role on. 
     * **Create a project** : To create a project, you need the Project Creator role (`roles/resourcemanager.projectCreator`), which contains the `resourcemanager.projects.create` permission. [Learn how to grant roles](https://docs.cloud.google.com/iam/docs/granting-changing-revoking-access). 
**Note** : If you don't plan to keep the resources that you create in this procedure, create a project instead of selecting an existing project. After you finish these steps, you can delete the project, removing all resources associated with the project.

[Go to project selector](https://console.cloud.google.com/projectselector2/home/dashboard)

  3. [Verify that billing is enabled for your Google Cloud project](https://docs.cloud.google.com/billing/docs/how-to/verify-billing-enabled#confirm_billing_is_enabled_on_a_project). 

  4. Enable the Data Lineage API, if it is not already enabled. 

**Roles required to enable APIs**

To enable APIs, you need the `serviceusage.services.enable` permission. If you created the project, then you likely already have this permission through the Owner role (`roles/owner`). Otherwise, you can get this permission through the Service Usage Admin role (`roles/serviceusage.serviceUsageAdmin`). [Learn how to grant roles](https://docs.cloud.google.com/iam/docs/granting-changing-revoking-access). 

[Enable the API](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/enableflow?apiid=datalineage.googleapis.com)

### Required roles

To get the permissions that you need to use the data lineage MCP server, ask your administrator to grant you the following IAM roles on the project where you want to use the data lineage MCP server: 

  * Make MCP tool calls: [MCP Tool User ](https://docs.cloud.google.com/iam/docs/roles-permissions/mcp#mcp.toolUser) (`roles/mcp.toolUser`) 
  * View data lineage information: [Data Lineage Viewer ](https://docs.cloud.google.com/iam/docs/roles-permissions/datalineage#datalineage.viewer) (`roles/datalineage.viewer`) 



For more information about granting roles, see [Manage access to projects, folders, and organizations](https://docs.cloud.google.com/iam/docs/granting-changing-revoking-access). 

These predefined roles contain the permissions required to use the data lineage MCP server. To see the exact permissions that are required, expand the **Required permissions** section: 

#### Required permissions

The following permissions are required to use the data lineage MCP server:

  * Make MCP tool calls: `mcp.tools.call`
  * Query data lineage in search for links: `datalineage.locations.searchLinks`



You might also be able to get these permissions with [custom roles](https://docs.cloud.google.com/iam/docs/creating-custom-roles) or other [predefined roles](https://docs.cloud.google.com/iam/docs/roles-overview#predefined). 

## Authentication and authorization

The Data Lineage API remote MCP server uses the [OAuth 2.0](https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/oauth2) protocol with [Identity and Access Management (IAM)](https://docs.cloud.google.com/iam/docs/overview) for authentication and authorization. All [Google Cloud identities](https://docs.cloud.google.com/docs/authentication/identity-products) are supported for authentication to MCP servers. 

We recommend that you create a separate identity for agents that are using MCP tools so that access to resources can be controlled and monitored. For more information about authentication, see [Authenticate to MCP servers](https://docs.cloud.google.com/mcp/authenticate-mcp).

### What MCP OAuth scopes do I need for data lineage?

OAuth 2.0 uses scopes and credentials to determine if an authenticated principal is authorized to take a specific action on a resource. For more information about OAuth 2.0 scopes at Google, read [Using OAuth 2.0 to access Google APIs](https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/oauth2).

Data lineage has the following MCP tool OAuth scopes:

Scope URI for gcloud CLI | Description  
---|---  
`https://www.googleapis.com/auth/datalineage.readonly` | Only allows access to read data.  
`https://www.googleapis.com/auth/datalineage.read-write` | Allows access to read and modify data.  
  
Additional scopes might be required on the resources accessed during a tool call. To view a list of scopes required for data lineage, see [Data Lineage API](https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/oauth2/scopes#datalineage).

## Configure an MCP client to use the data lineage MCP server

AI applications and agents, such as Claude or Antigravity, can instantiate an MCP client that connects to a single MCP server. An AI application can have multiple clients that connect to different MCP servers. If your application isn't listed in the [client-specific guidance](https://docs.cloud.google.com/mcp/configure-mcp-ai-application#client-specific-guidance), then you can use the following information to connect from most applications.

In your AI application, look for a way to add or connect to a remote MCP server. For the data lineage MCP server, enter the following information as required:

  * **Server name** : data lineage MCP server
  * **Server URL** or **Endpoint** : 
    * Global endpoint: `https://datalineage.googleapis.com/mcp`
    * Regional endpoints: `https://REGION-datalineage.googleapis.com/mcp`. Replace REGION with the one of the [supported regions](https://docs.cloud.google.com/knowledge-catalog/docs/locations).
  * **Transport** : [Streamable HTTP](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/latest/basic/transports/streamable-http)
  * **Authentication details** : depending on how you want to authenticate, you can enter your Google Cloud credentials, your OAuth Client ID and secret, or an agent identity and credentials. For more information about authentication, see [Authenticate to MCP servers](https://docs.cloud.google.com/mcp/authenticate-mcp).
  * **OAuth scope** : the [OAuth 2.0 scope](https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/oauth2/scopes) that you want to use when connecting to the data lineage MCP server.



### Redirect URIs

For web-based applications, and some desktop applications, you must allowlist a redirect URI when you create a client ID and secret for authentication. Redirect URIs are used by the authorization server to send tokens to your application. Your application's documentation should specify the redirect URI that you must use. [Custom redirect URIs](https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/oauth2/native-app#redirect-uri_custom-scheme) aren't supported.

For application-specific guidance about setting up and connecting to MCP server, see [Client-specific guidance](https://docs.cloud.google.com/mcp/configure-mcp-ai-application#client-specific-guidance).

For more general guidance, see the following resources:

  * [Connect to remote MCP servers](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs/develop/connect-remote-servers).
  * [Configure MCP in an AI application](https://docs.cloud.google.com/mcp/configure-mcp-ai-application).



## What MCP tools does data lineage provide?

To view details of available MCP tools and their descriptions for the data lineage MCP server, see the [data lineage MCP reference](https://docs.cloud.google.com/knowledge-catalog/docs/reference/mcp).

### List tools

Use the [MCP inspector](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs/tools/inspector) to list tools, or send a `tools/list` HTTP request directly to the data lineage remote MCP server. The `tools/list` method doesn't require authentication.
    
    
    curl -X POST https://datalineage.googleapis.com/TOOLSET_ENDPOINT \
        -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
        -H 'Accept: application/json' \
        -H 'MCP-Protocol-Version: MCP_PROTOCOL_VERSION' \
        -H 'Mcp-Method: tools/list' \
        -d '{
          "jsonrpc": "2.0",
          "id": 1,
          "method": "tools/list",
          "params": {
            "_meta": {
              "io.modelcontextprotocol/protocolVersion": "MCP_PROTOCOL_VERSION",
              "io.modelcontextprotocol/clientCapabilities": {
                "extensions": {
                  "io.modelcontextprotocol/ui": {
                    "mimeTypes": ["text/html;profile=mcp-app"]
                  }
                }
              }
            }
          }
        }'
    

Replace the following:

  * `TOOLSET_ENDPOINT`: the remainder of the MCP endpoint after the service name. For example, for data lineage, this might be `mcp/toolset-name`.
  * `MCP_PROTOCOL_VERSION`: the MCP protocol version. For example, `2026-07-28`.



## Example use cases

Example use cases for the data lineage MCP server include:

  * Discovering all upstream data sources and transformation processes that feed into a specific data asset to verify data origin and accuracy.
  * Analyzing the impact of broken, stalled, or delayed data pipelines on downstream data consumers.



## Sample prompts

  * "In my project `my-analytics-project`, I have a dataset `sales_data` with a table called `monthly_reports`. Tell me all the data assets and transformation processes that feed data into this table."
  * "I have a BigQuery job that writes into the `hr_dataset.salary` table. I see the job has been failing to run for 12 hours now. Can you tell me which downstream assets will have stale data because of this issue?"
  * "Go through the `monthly_reports` table in `sales_data` dataset and `my-analytics-project` project to find all the columns that have upstream data sources, and give me all the processes that feed into these columns."
  * "Search for lineage links connected to table `finance.employment_costs` to understand its upstream dependencies."



## Optional security and safety configurations

MCP introduces new security risks and considerations due to the wide variety of actions that you can do with the MCP tools. To minimize and manage these risks, Google Cloud offers default settings and customizable policies to control the use of MCP tools in your Google Cloud organization or project.

For more information about MCP security and governance, see [AI security and safety](https://docs.cloud.google.com/mcp/ai-security-safety).

### Control MCP use with IAM policies

Identity and Access Management (IAM) [deny policies](https://docs.cloud.google.com/iam/docs/deny-overview) and [allow policies](https://docs.cloud.google.com/iam/docs/allow-policies) help you secure Google Cloud and Google MCP servers.

You can combine multiple criteria to build customized security and governance policies by allowing or denying access based on the following:

  * The principal.
  * Tool properties like the read-only attribute.
  * The service name or tool name.
  * The application's OAuth client ID.



For more information, see [Control MCP use with Identity and Access Management](https://docs.cloud.google.com/mcp/control-mcp-use-iam).
