#  Compute Engine IAM roles and permissions Stay organized with collections  Save and categorize content based on your preferences. 

When you add a new member to your project, you can use an [Identity and Access Management (IAM)](https://docs.cloud.google.com/iam) policy to give that member one or more IAM roles. Each IAM role contains permissions that grant the member access to specific resources.

Compute Engine has a set of predefined IAM roles that are described on this page. You can also [create custom roles](https://docs.cloud.google.com/iam/docs/creating-custom-roles) that contain subsets of permissions that map directly to your needs.

To learn which permissions are required for each method, see the Compute Engine API reference documentation:

  * [Compute Engine v1 API reference](https://docs.cloud.google.com/compute/docs/reference/rest/v1)
  * [Compute Engine beta API reference](https://docs.cloud.google.com/compute/docs/reference/rest/beta)



For information about granting access, see the following pages.

  * To set IAM policies at a project level, see [Manage access to projects, folders, and organizations](https://docs.cloud.google.com/iam/docs/granting-changing-revoking-access) in the IAM documentation.
  * To set policies on specific Compute Engine resources, read [Granting access to Compute Engine resources](https://docs.cloud.google.com/compute/docs/access/managing-access-to-resources#bind-member).
  * To assign roles to a Compute Engine service account, read [Create a VM that uses a user-managed service account](https://docs.cloud.google.com/compute/docs/access/create-enable-service-accounts-for-instances).



## What is IAM?

Google Cloud offers [IAM](https://docs.cloud.google.com/iam), which lets you give more granular access to specific Google Cloud resources and prevents unwanted access to other resources. IAM lets you adopt the [security principle of least privilege](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principle_of_least_privilege), so you grant only the necessary access to your resources.

IAM lets you control _who (identity)_ has _what (roles)_ permission to _which_ resources by setting IAM policies. IAM policies grant specific roles to a project member, giving that identity certain permissions. For example, for a given resource, such as a project, you can assign the Compute Network Admin role (`roles/compute.networkAdmin`) to a user account (a Google Account or an account from an [external identity provider](https://docs.cloud.google.com/iam/docs/workforce-identity-federation)) and that account can control network-related resources in the project, but cannot manage other resources, like instances and disks. You can also use IAM to manage the [Google Cloud console legacy roles](https://docs.cloud.google.com/compute/docs/access/project-team-members) granted to project team members.

## The serviceAccountUser role

When granted together with the Compute Instance Admin (v1) role (`roles/compute.instanceAdmin.v1`), the [Service Account User role](https://docs.cloud.google.com/iam/docs/service-account-permissions#user-role) (`roles/iam.serviceAccountUser`) gives members the ability to create and manage instances that use a service account. Specifically, granting `roles/iam.serviceAccountUser` and `roles/compute.instanceAdmin.v1` together gives members permission to do the following:

  * Create an instance that runs as a [service account](https://docs.cloud.google.com/compute/docs/access/service-accounts).
  * Attach a persistent disk to an instance that runs as a service account.
  * Set instance metadata on an instance that runs as a service account.
  * Use SSH to connect to an instance that runs as a service account.
  * Reconfigure an instance to run as a service account.



You can grant the Service Account User role (`roles/iam.serviceAccountUser`) in one of two ways:

  * **Recommended**. Grant the role to a member on a [specific service account](https://docs.cloud.google.com/iam/docs/manage-access-service-accounts). This gives a member access to the service account for which they are an `iam.serviceAccountUser` but prevents access to other service accounts for which the member is not an `iam.serviceAccountUser`.

  * Grant the role to a member on the [project level](https://docs.cloud.google.com/iam/docs/managing-policies). The member has access to all service accounts in the project, including service accounts that are created in the future.




If you aren't familiar with service accounts, [learn more about service accounts](https://docs.cloud.google.com/compute/docs/access/service-accounts).

## Google Cloud console permission

To use the [Google Cloud console](https://console.cloud.google.com/) to access Compute Engine resources, you must have a role that contains the following permission on the project:
    
    
    compute.projects.get
    

## Connecting to an instance as an instanceAdmin

After you grant a project member the `roles/compute.instanceAdmin.v1` role, they can connect to virtual machine (VM) instances by using standard Google Cloud tools, like the [gcloud CLI](https://docs.cloud.google.com/sdk/docs) or [SSH-in-browser](https://docs.cloud.google.com/compute/docs/connect/ssh-in-browser).

When a member uses the gcloud CLI or SSH-in-browser, the tools automatically generate a public/private key pair and add the public key to the project metadata. If the member does not have permissions to edit project metadata, the tool adds the member's public key to the instance metadata instead.

If the member has an existing key pair they want to use, they can manually add their public key to the instance's metadata. [Learn more about adding SSH keys to an instance](https://docs.cloud.google.com/compute/docs/connect/add-ssh-keys#add_ssh_keys_to_instance_metadata).

## IAM with service accounts

Create new custom service accounts and grant IAM roles to service accounts to limit the access of your instances. Use IAM roles with custom service accounts to:

  * Limit the access your instances have to Google Cloud APIs using granular IAM roles.
  * Give each instance, or set of instances, a unique identity.
  * Limit the access of your default service account.



[Learn more about service accounts](https://docs.cloud.google.com/compute/docs/access/service-accounts).

## Managed instance groups and IAM

[Managed instance groups (MIGs)](https://docs.cloud.google.com/compute/docs/instance-groups) are resources that perform actions on your behalf without direct user interaction. For example, the MIG can add and remove VMs from the group.

All of the operations performed by Compute Engine as part of the MIG are performed by the [**Google APIs Service Agent**](https://docs.cloud.google.com/compute/docs/access/service-accounts#google_apis_service_agent) for your project, which has an email address like the following: `PROJECT_ID@cloudservices.gserviceaccount.com`

By default, the Google APIs Service Agent is granted the Instance Group Manager Service Agent role (`roles/compute.instanceGroupManagerServiceAgent`) at the project level, which gives enough privileges to create resources based on the MIG's configuration. If you're customizing access for the Google APIs Service Agent, then grant the Compute Instance Admin (v1) role (`roles/compute.instanceAdmin.v1`) and, optionally, the Service Account User role (`roles/iam.serviceAccountUser`). The Service Account User role is required only if the MIG creates VMs that can run as a service account.

Note that the Google APIs Service Agent is also used by other processes, including [Deployment Manager](https://docs.cloud.google.com/deployment-manager).

When you create a MIG or update its instance template, Compute Engine validates that the Google APIs Service Agent has the following role and permissions:

  * Service Account User role, which is important if you plan to create instances that can run as a service account
  * Permissions to all the resources referenced from instance templates, such as images, disks, VPC networks, and subnets



## Predefined Compute Engine IAM roles

With IAM, every API method in Compute Engine API requires that the identity making the API request has the appropriate permissions to use the resource. Permissions are granted by setting policies that grant _roles_ to a _member_ (user, group, or service account) of your project.

In addition to basic roles ([viewer, editor, owner](https://docs.cloud.google.com/iam/docs/roles-overview#basic)) and [custom roles](https://docs.cloud.google.com/iam/docs/understanding-custom-roles), you can assign the following Compute Engine predefined roles to the members of your project.

You can grant multiple roles to a project member on the same resource. For example, if your networking team also manages firewall rules, you can grant both `roles/compute.networkAdmin` and `roles/compute.securityAdmin` to the networking team's [Google group](https://docs.cloud.google.com/iam/docs/overview#google_group).

The following tables describe the predefined Compute Engine IAM roles, as well as the permissions contained within each role. Each role contains a set of permissions that is suitable for a specific task. For example, the Instance Admin roles grant permissions to manage instances, the network-related roles include permissions to manage network-related resources, and the security role includes permissions to manage security-related resources, like firewalls and SSL certificates. When working on Compute Engine, you might also need roles for other services such as Cloud DNS and IAM service accounts. For a full list of IAM roles, see the [IAM role reference documentation](https://docs.cloud.google.com/iam/docs/understanding-roles).

#### Compute Instance Admin (beta) 

(`roles/compute.instanceAdmin`) Permissions to create, modify, and delete virtual machine instances. This includes permissions to create, modify, and delete disks, and also to configure [Shielded VM](https://docs.cloud.google.com/compute/shielded-vm/docs) settings.  If the user will be managing virtual machine instances that are configured to run as a service account, you must also grant the `roles/iam.serviceAccountUser` role.  For example, if your company has someone who manages groups of virtual machine instances but does not manage network or security settings and does not manage instances that run as service accounts, you can grant this role on the organization, folder, or project that contains the instances, or you can grant it on individual instances.  Lowest-level resources where you can grant this role:

  * Disk 
  * Image 
  * Instance 
  * Instance template 
  * Snapshot

#### Compute Load Balancer Admin 

(`roles/compute.loadBalancerAdmin`) Permissions to create, modify, and delete load balancers and associate resources.  For example, if your company has a load balancing team that manages load balancers, SSL certificates for load balancers, SSL policies, and other load balancing resources, and a separate networking team that manages the rest of the networking resources, then grant this role to the load balancing team's group.  Lowest-level resources where you can grant this role:

#### Compute Network Admin 

(`roles/compute.networkAdmin`) Permissions to create, modify, and delete networking resources, except for firewall rules and SSL certificates. The network admin role allows read-only access to firewall rules, SSL certificates, and instances (to view their ephemeral IP addresses). The network admin role does not allow a user to create, start, stop, or delete instances.  For example, if your company has a security team that manages firewalls and SSL certificates and a networking team that manages the rest of the networking resources, then grant this role to the networking team's group. Or, if you have a combined team that manages both security and networking, then grant this role as well as the  `roles/compute.securityAdmin` role to the combined team's group.  Lowest-level resources where you can grant this role:

(`roles/compute.securityAdmin`) Permissions to create, modify, and delete firewall rules and SSL certificates, and also to configure [Shielded VM](https://docs.cloud.google.com/compute/shielded-vm/docs) settings.  For example, if your company has a security team that manages firewalls and SSL certificates and a networking team that manages the rest of the networking resources, then grant this role to the security team's group.  Lowest-level resources where you can grant this role:

#### Compute Shared VPC Admin 

(`roles/compute.xpnAdmin`) Permissions to administer [shared VPC](https://docs.cloud.google.com/vpc/docs/shared-vpc) host projects, specifically enabling the host projects and associating shared VPC service projects to the host project's network.  At the organization level, this role can only be granted by an organization admin.  Google Cloud recommends that the Shared VPC Admin be the owner of the shared VPC host project. The Shared VPC Admin is responsible for granting the Compute Network User role (`roles/compute.networkUser`) to service owners, and the shared VPC host project owner controls the project itself. Managing the project is easier if a single principal (individual or group) can fulfill both roles.  Lowest-level resources where you can grant this role:
