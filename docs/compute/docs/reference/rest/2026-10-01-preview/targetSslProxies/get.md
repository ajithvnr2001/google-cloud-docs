API Version : 2026-10-01-preview

Returns the specified TargetSslProxy resource.

### HTTP request

Choose an endpoint:

globalafrica-south1asia-east1asia-east2asia-northeast1asia-northeast2asia-northeast3asia-south1asia-south2asia-southeast1asia-southeast2asia-southeast3australia-southeast1australia-southeast2europe-central2europe-north1europe-north2europe-southwest1europe-west1europe-west10europe-west12europe-west2europe-west3europe-west4europe-west6europe-west8europe-west9me-central1me-central2me-west1northamerica-northeast1northamerica-northeast2northamerica-south1southamerica-east1southamerica-west1us-central1us-east1us-east4us-east5us-south1us-west1us-west2us-west3us-west4

  
`GET https://compute.googleapis.com/compute/v1/projects/{project}/global/targetSslProxies/{targetSslProxy}?$apiVersion=2026-10-01-preview`

The URLs use [gRPC Transcoding](https://google.aip.dev/127) syntax.

### Path parameters

Parameters  
---  
`project` |  `string` Project ID for this request.  
`targetSslProxy` |  `string` Name of the TargetSslProxy resource to return.  
  
### Request body

The request body must be empty.

### Response body

Represents a Target SSL Proxy resource.

A target SSL proxy is a component of a Proxy Network Load Balancer. The forwarding rule references the target SSL proxy, and the target proxy then references a backend service. For more information, read [Proxy Network Load Balancer overview](https://docs.cloud.google.com/load-balancing/docs/proxy-network-load-balancer).

If successful, the response body contains data with the following structure:

    }  
  
Fields  
---  
`kind` |  `string` Output only. Type of the resource. Always `compute#targetSslProxy` for target SSL proxies.  
`id` |  `string ([uint64](https://developers.google.com/discovery/v1/type-format) format)` Output only. The unique identifier for the resource. This identifier is defined by the server.  
`creationTimestamp` |  `string` Output only. Creation timestamp in [RFC3339](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3339.txt) text format.  
`name` |  `string` Name of the resource. Provided by the client when the resource is created. The name must be 1-63 characters long, and comply with [RFC1035](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1035.txt). Specifically, the name must be 1-63 characters long and match the regular expression `[a-z]([-a-z0-9]*[a-z0-9])?` which means the first character must be a lowercase letter, and all following characters must be a dash, lowercase letter, or digit, except the last character, which cannot be a dash.  
`description` |  `string` An optional description of this resource. Provide this property when you create the resource.  
`selfLink` |  `string` Output only. Server-defined URL for the resource.  
`service` |  `string` URL to the BackendService resource.  
`sslCertificates[]` |  `string` URLs to `SslCertificate` resources that are used to authenticate connections to Backends. At least one SSL certificate must be specified. Currently, you may specify up to 15 SSL certificates. sslCertificates do not apply when the load balancing scheme is set to INTERNAL_SELF_MANAGED.  
`certificateMap` |  `string` URL of a certificate map that identifies a certificate map associated with the given target proxy. This field can only be set for global target proxies. If set, sslCertificates will be ignored.  Accepted format is `//certificatemanager.googleapis.com/projects/{project}/locations/{location}/certificateMaps/{resourceName}`.  
`proxyHeader` |  `enum` Specifies the type of proxy header to append before sending data to the backend, either `NONE` or `PROXY_V1`. The default is `NONE`.  
`sslPolicy` |  `string` URL of SslPolicy resource that will be associated with the TargetSslProxy resource. If not set, the TargetSslProxy resource will not have any SSL policy configured.  
  
### Authorization scopes

Requires one of the following OAuth scopes:

  * `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/compute.readonly`
  * ` https://www.googleapis.com/auth/compute`
  * ` https://www.googleapis.com/auth/cloud-platform`



For more information, see the [Authentication Overview](https://docs.cloud.google.com/docs/authentication#authorization-gcp).

### IAM Permissions

In addition to any permissions specified on the fields above, authorization requires one or more of the following [IAM](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/) permissions:

  * `compute.targetSslProxies.get`



To find predefined roles that contain those permissions, see [Compute Engine IAM Roles](https://docs.cloud.google.com/compute/docs/access/iam).
