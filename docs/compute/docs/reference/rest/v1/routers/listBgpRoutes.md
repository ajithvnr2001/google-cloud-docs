Retrieves a list of router bgp routes available to the specified project.

### HTTP request

Choose an endpoint:

globalafrica-south1asia-east1asia-east2asia-northeast1asia-northeast2asia-northeast3asia-south1asia-south2asia-southeast1asia-southeast2asia-southeast3australia-southeast1australia-southeast2europe-central2europe-north1europe-north2europe-southwest1europe-west1europe-west10europe-west12europe-west2europe-west3europe-west4europe-west6europe-west8europe-west9me-central1me-central2me-west1northamerica-northeast1northamerica-northeast2northamerica-south1southamerica-east1southamerica-west1us-central1us-east1us-east4us-east5us-south1us-west1us-west2us-west3us-west4

  
`GET https://compute.googleapis.com/compute/v1/projects/{project}/regions/{region}/routers/{router}/listBgpRoutes`

The URLs use [gRPC Transcoding](https://google.aip.dev/127) syntax.

### Path parameters

Parameters  
---  
`project` |  `string` Project ID for this request.  
`region` |  `string` Name of the region for this request.  
`router` |  `string` Name or id of the resource for this request. Name should conform to RFC1035.  
  
### Query parameters

Parameters  
---  
`maxResults` |  `integer ([uint32](https://developers.google.com/discovery/v1/type-format) format)` The maximum number of results per page that should be returned. If the number of available results is larger than `maxResults`, Compute Engine returns a `nextPageToken` that can be used to get the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are `0` to `500`, inclusive. (Default: `500`)  
`pageToken` |  `string` Specifies a page token to use. Set `pageToken` to the `nextPageToken` returned by a previous list request to get the next page of results.  
`filter` |  `string` A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response. Most Compute resources support two types of filter expressions: expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow API improvement proposal [AIP-160](https://google.aip.dev/160). These two types of filter expressions cannot be mixed in one request.If you want to use AIP-160, your expression must specify the field name, an operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. The value must be a string, a number, or a boolean. The operator must be either `=`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `<=`, `>=` or `:`.For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying `name != example-instance`.The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key has been defined. For example, to find all objects with `owner` label use:
    
    
    labels.owner:*
    

You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify `scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to include instances only if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering on nested fields to filter based on [resource labels](https://docs.cloud.google.com/compute/docs/labeling-resources).To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within parentheses. For example:
    
    
    (scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
    (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake")
    

By default, each expression is an `AND` expression. However, you can include `AND` and `OR` expressions explicitly. For example:
    
    
    (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR
    (cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND
    (scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
    

If you want to use a regular expression, use the `eq` (equal) or `ne` (not equal) operator against a single un-parenthesized expression with or without quotes or against multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples:`fieldname eq unquoted literal` `fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'` `fieldname eq "double quoted literal"` `(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")`The literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using Google [RE2](https://github.com/google/re2/wiki/Syntax) library syntax. The literal value must match the entire field.For example, to filter for instances that do not end with name "instance", you would use `name ne .*instance`.You cannot combine constraints on multiple fields using regular expressions.  
`orderBy` |  `string` Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results are returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name.You can also sort results in descending order based on the creation timestamp using `orderBy="creationTimestamp desc"`. This sorts results based on the `creationTimestamp` field in reverse chronological order (newest result first). Use this to sort resources like operations so that the newest operation is returned first.Currently, only sorting by `name` or `creationTimestamp desc` is supported.  
`returnPartialSuccess` |  `boolean` Opt-in for partial success behavior which provides partial results in case of failure. The default value is false.For example, when partial success behavior is enabled, aggregatedList for a single zone scope either returns all resources in the zone or no resources, with an error code.  
`peer` |  `string` (Required) limit results to the BGP peer with the given name. Name should conform to RFC1035.  
`addressFamily` |  `enum` (Required) limit results to this address family (either IPv4 or IPv6)  
`routeType` |  `enum` (Required) limit results to this type of route (either LEARNED or ADVERTISED)  
`policyApplied` |  `boolean` When true, the method returns post-policy routes. Otherwise, it returns pre-policy routes.  
`destinationPrefix` |  `string` Limit results to destinations that are subnets of this CIDR range  
  
### Request body

The request body must be empty.

Fields  
---  
`kind` |  `string` Output only. Type of resource. Always `compute#routersListBgpRoutes` for lists of bgp routes.  
`id` |  `string` Output only. The unique identifier for the resource. This identifier is defined by the server.  
`result[]` |  `object` Output only. A list of bgp routes.  
`result[].destination` |  `object` Output only. Destination IP range for the route, in human-readable CIDR format  
`result[].destination.prefix` |  `string` Human readable CIDR notation for a prefix. E.g. 10.42.0.0/16.  
`result[].destination.pathId` |  `integer ([uint32](https://developers.google.com/discovery/v1/type-format) format)` If the BGP session supports multiple paths (RFC 7911), the path identifier for this route.  
`result[].asPaths[]` |  `object` Output only. AS-PATH for the route  
`result[].asPaths[].type` |  `enum` Output only. Type of AS-PATH segment (SEQUENCE or SET)  
`result[].asPaths[].asns[]` |  `integer` Output only. ASNs in the path segment. When type is SEQUENCE, these are ordered.  
`result[].asPaths[].asns32[]` |  `integer ([uint32](https://developers.google.com/discovery/v1/type-format) format)` Output only. ASNs in the path segment. This field is for better support of 32 bit ASNs as the other asns field suffers from overflow when the ASN is larger. When type is SEQUENCE, these are ordered.  
`result[].communities[]` |  `string` Output only. BGP communities in human-readable A:B format.  
`result[].origin` |  `enum` Output only. BGP origin (EGP, IGP or INCOMPLETE)  
`result[].med` |  `integer ([uint32](https://developers.google.com/discovery/v1/type-format) format)` Output only. BGP multi-exit discriminator  
`nextPageToken` |  `string` Output only. This token allows you to get the next page of results for list requests. If the number of results is larger than `maxResults`, use the `nextPageToken` as a value for the query parameter `pageToken` in the next list request. Subsequent list requests will have their own `nextPageToken` to continue paging through the results.  
`selfLink` |  `string` Output only. Server-defined URL for this resource.  
`warning` |  `object` Output only. Informational warning message.  
`warning.code` |  `enum` Output only. A warning code, if applicable. For example, Compute Engine returns `NO_RESULTS_ON_PAGE` if there are no results in the response.  
`warning.message` |  `string` Output only. A human-readable description of the warning code.  
`warning.data[]` |  `object` Output only. Metadata about this warning in `key: value` format. For example: 
    
    
    "data": [  {  "key": "scope",  "value": "zones/us-east1-d"  }]  
  
`warning.data[].key` |  `string` Output only. A key that provides more detail on the warning being returned. For example, for warnings where there are no results in a list request for a particular zone, this key might be `scope` and the key value might be the zone name. Other examples might be a key indicating a deprecated resource and a suggested replacement, or a warning about invalid network settings (for example, if an instance attempts to perform IP forwarding but is not enabled for IP forwarding).  
`warning.data[].value` |  `string` Output only. A warning data value corresponding to the key.  
`etag` |  `string`  
`unreachables[]` |  `string` Output only. Unreachable resources.
