API Version : 2026-09-01

Returns the specified accelerator type.

### HTTP request

Choose an endpoint:

globalafrica-south1asia-east1asia-east2asia-northeast1asia-northeast2asia-northeast3asia-south1asia-south2asia-southeast1asia-southeast2asia-southeast3australia-southeast1australia-southeast2europe-central2europe-north1europe-north2europe-southwest1europe-west1europe-west10europe-west12europe-west2europe-west3europe-west4europe-west6europe-west8europe-west9me-central1me-central2me-west1northamerica-northeast1northamerica-northeast2northamerica-south1southamerica-east1southamerica-west1us-central1us-east1us-east4us-east5us-south1us-west1us-west2us-west3us-west4

  
`GET https://compute.googleapis.com/compute/v1/projects/{project}/zones/{zone}/acceleratorTypes/{acceleratorType}?$apiVersion=2026-09-01`

The URLs use [gRPC Transcoding](https://google.aip.dev/127) syntax.

### Path parameters

Parameters  
---  
`project` |  `string` Project ID for this request.  
`zone` |  `string` The name of the zone for this request.  
`acceleratorType` |  `string` Name of the accelerator type to return.  
  
### Request body

The request body must be empty.

### Response body

Represents an Accelerator Type resource.

Google Cloud Platform provides graphics processing units (accelerators) that you can add to VM instances to improve or accelerate performance when working with intensive workloads. For more information, read [GPUs on Compute Engine](https://docs.cloud.google.com/compute/docs/gpus).

If successful, the response body contains data with the following structure:

Fields  
---  
`kind` |  `string` Output only. The type of the resource. Always `compute#acceleratorType` for accelerator types.  
`id` |  `string ([uint64](https://developers.google.com/discovery/v1/type-format) format)` Output only. The unique identifier for the resource. This identifier is defined by the server.  
`creationTimestamp` |  `string` Output only. Creation timestamp in [RFC3339](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3339.txt) text format.  
`name` |  `string` Output only. Name of the resource.  
`description` |  `string` Output only. An optional textual description of the resource.  
`deprecated` |  `object` Output only. The deprecation status associated with this accelerator type.  
`deprecated.state` |  `enum` The deprecation state of this resource. This can be `ACTIVE`, `DEPRECATED`, `OBSOLETE`, or `DELETED`. Operations which communicate the end of life date for an image, can use `ACTIVE`. Operations which create a new resource using a `DEPRECATED` resource will return successfully, but with a warning indicating the deprecated resource and recommending its replacement. Operations which use `OBSOLETE` or `DELETED` resources will be rejected and result in an error.  
`deprecated.replacement` |  `string` The URL of the suggested replacement for a deprecated resource. The suggested replacement resource must be the same kind of resource as the deprecated resource.  
`deprecated.deprecated` |  `string` An optional [RFC3339](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3339.txt) timestamp on or after which the state of this resource is intended to change to `DEPRECATED`. This is only informational and the status will not change unless the client explicitly changes it.  
`deprecated.obsolete` |  `string` An optional [RFC3339](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3339.txt) timestamp on or after which the state of this resource is intended to change to `OBSOLETE`. This is only informational and the status will not change unless the client explicitly changes it.  
`deprecated.deleted` |  `string` An optional [RFC3339](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3339.txt) timestamp on or after which the state of this resource is intended to change to `DELETED`. This is only informational and the status will not change unless the client explicitly changes it.  
`zone` |  `string` Output only. The name of the zone where the accelerator type resides, such as us-central1-a. You must specify this field as part of the HTTP request URL. It is not settable as a field in the request body.  
`selfLink` |  `string` Output only. Server-defined, fully qualified URL for this resource.  
`maximumCardsPerInstance` |  `integer` Output only. Maximum number of accelerator cards allowed per instance.  
`resourceMetadata` |  `object` Output only. Contains standard resource metadata for an AcceleratorType resource. It is populated for each instance of the AcceleratorType resource, and includes the `apiVersion` the instance was retrieved through, and its canonical `resourceType` name. Available from version 2026-09-01.  
`resourceMetadata.resourceType` |  `string` The canonical resource type name in the format of a resource type as defined by [AIP-123](https://google.aip.dev/123). For example, `"compute.googleapis.com/Instance"`.  
`resourceMetadata.apiVersion` |  `string` The version of the API interface that this resource was retrieved through. For example, `"2025-01-01"` or `"2025-01-01-preview"`.  
  
### Authorization scopes

Requires one of the following OAuth scopes:

  * `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/compute.readonly`
  * ` https://www.googleapis.com/auth/compute`
  * ` https://www.googleapis.com/auth/cloud-platform`



For more information, see the [Authentication Overview](https://docs.cloud.google.com/docs/authentication#authorization-gcp).

### IAM Permissions

In addition to any permissions specified on the fields above, authorization requires one or more of the following [IAM](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/) permissions:

  * `compute.acceleratorTypes.get`



To find predefined roles that contain those permissions, see [Compute Engine IAM Roles](https://docs.cloud.google.com/compute/docs/access/iam).
