API Version : 2026-09-01

Returns the specified externalVpnGateway. externalVpnGateways.get a list of available externalVpnGateways by making a `list()` request.

### HTTP request

`GET https://compute.googleapis.com/compute/v1/projects/{project}/global/externalVpnGateways/{externalVpnGateway}?$apiVersion=2026-09-01`

The URLs use [gRPC Transcoding](https://google.aip.dev/127) syntax.

### Path parameters

Parameters  
---  
`project` |  `string` Project ID for this request.  
`externalVpnGateway` |  `string` Name of the externalVpnGateway to return.  
  
### Request body

The request body must be empty.

### Response body

Represents an external VPN gateway.

External VPN gateway is the on-premises VPN gateway(s) or another cloud provider's VPN gateway that connects to your Google Cloud VPN gateway.

To create a highly available VPN from Google Cloud Platform to your VPN gateway or another cloud provider's VPN gateway, you must create a external VPN gateway resource with information about the other gateway.

For more information about using external VPN gateways, see [ Creating an HA VPN gateway and tunnel pair to a peer VPN](https://cloud.google.com/network-connectivity/docs/vpn/how-to/creating-ha-vpn#creating-ha-gw-peer-tunnel).

If successful, the response body contains data with the following structure:

Fields  
---  
`kind` |  `string` Output only. Type of the resource. Always `compute#externalVpnGateway` for externalVpnGateways.  
`description` |  `string` An optional description of this resource. Provide this property when you create the resource.  
`selfLink` |  `string` Output only. Server-defined URL for the resource.  
`id` |  `string ([uint64](https://developers.google.com/discovery/v1/type-format) format)` Output only. The unique identifier for the resource. This identifier is defined by the server.  
`creationTimestamp` |  `string` Output only. Creation timestamp in [RFC3339](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3339.txt) text format.  
`name` |  `string` Name of the resource. Provided by the client when the resource is created. The name must be 1-63 characters long, and comply with [RFC1035](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1035.txt). Specifically, the name must be 1-63 characters long and match the regular expression `[a-z]([-a-z0-9]*[a-z0-9])?` which means the first character must be a lowercase letter, and all following characters must be a dash, lowercase letter, or digit, except the last character, which cannot be a dash.  
`redundancyType` |  `enum` Indicates the user-supplied redundancy type of this external VPN gateway.  
`interfaces[]` |  `object` A list of interfaces for this external VPN gateway.If your peer-side gateway is an on-premises gateway and non-AWS cloud providers' gateway, at most two interfaces can be provided for an external VPN gateway. If your peer side is an AWS virtual private gateway, four interfaces should be provided for an external VPN gateway.  
`interfaces[].id` |  `integer ([uint32](https://developers.google.com/discovery/v1/type-format) format)` The numeric ID of this interface. The allowed input values for this id for different redundancy types of external VPN gateway: 

  * SINGLE_IP_INTERNALLY_REDUNDANT - 0
  * TWO_IPS_REDUNDANCY - 0, 1
  * FOUR_IPS_REDUNDANCY - 0, 1, 2, 3

  
`interfaces[].ipAddress` |  `string` IP address of the interface in the external VPN gateway. Only IPv4 is supported. This IP address can be either from your on-premise gateway or another Cloud provider's VPN gateway, it cannot be an IP address from Google Compute Engine.  
`interfaces[].ipv6Address` |  `string` IPv6 address of the interface in the external VPN gateway. This IPv6 address can be either from your on-premise gateway or another Cloud provider's VPN gateway, it cannot be an IP address from Google Compute Engine. Must specify an IPv6 address (not IPV4-mapped) using any format described in RFC 4291 (e.g. 2001:db8:0:0:2d9:51:0:0). The output format is RFC 5952 format (e.g. 2001:db8::2d9:51:0:0).  
`labels` |  `map (key: string, value: string)` Labels for this resource. These can only be added or modified by the `setLabels` method. Each label key/value pair must comply with [RFC1035](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1035.txt). Label values may be empty.  
`labelFingerprint` |  `string ([bytes](https://developers.google.com/discovery/v1/type-format) format)` A fingerprint for the labels being applied to this ExternalVpnGateway, which is essentially a hash of the labels set used for optimistic locking. The fingerprint is initially generated by Compute Engine and changes after every request to modify or update labels. You must always provide an up-to-date fingerprint hash in order to update or change labels, otherwise the request will fail with error `412 conditionNotMet`.To see the latest fingerprint, make a `get()` request to retrieve an ExternalVpnGateway.A base64-encoded string.  
`params` |  `object` Input only. [Input Only] Additional params passed with the request, but not persisted as part of resource payload.  
`params.resourceManagerTags` |  `map (key: string, value: string)` Tag keys/values directly bound to this resource. Tag keys and values have the same definition as resource manager tags. The field is allowed for INSERT only. The keys/values to set on the resource should be specified in either ID { : } or Namespaced format { : }. For example the following are valid inputs: * {"tagKeys/333" : "tagValues/444", "tagKeys/123" : "tagValues/456"} * {"123/environment" : "production", "345/abc" : "xyz"} Note: * Invalid combinations of ID & namespaced format is not supported. For instance: {"123/environment" : "tagValues/444"} is invalid. * Inconsistent format is not supported. For instance: {"tagKeys/333" : "tagValues/444", "123/env" : "prod"} is invalid.  
  
### Authorization scopes
