#  Delete a custom image Stay organized with collections  Save and categorize content based on your preferences. 

Linux  Windows 

You can only delete custom images that you, or someone who has access to the project, have added.

**Warning:** Deleting a custom image is irreversible. You can't recover a deleted custom image.

If you want to retain a backup of the image, [export the custom image to Cloud Storage](https://docs.cloud.google.com/compute/docs/images/export-image) before deleting it.

## Before you begin

  * Read the [Images](https://docs.cloud.google.com/compute/docs/images) document.
  * If you haven't already, set up [authentication](https://docs.cloud.google.com/compute/docs/authentication). Authentication verifies your identity for access to Google Cloud services and APIs. To run code or samples from a local development environment, you can authenticate to Compute Engine by selecting one of the following options: 

Select the tab for how you plan to use the samples on this page:

### Console

When you use the Google Cloud console to access Google Cloud services and APIs, you don't need to set up authentication. 

### gcloud

    1. [Install](https://docs.cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/install) the Google Cloud CLI. After installation, [initialize](https://docs.cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/initializing) the Google Cloud CLI by running the following command: 
           
           gcloud init

If you're using an external identity provider (IdP), you must first [ sign in to the gcloud CLI with your federated identity](https://docs.cloud.google.com/iam/docs/workforce-log-in-gcloud). 

**Note:** If you installed the gcloud CLI previously, make sure you have the latest version by running `gcloud components update`. 
    2. [ Set a default region and zone](https://docs.cloud.google.com/compute/docs/gcloud-compute#set_default_zone_and_region_in_your_local_client).

### Python

To use the Python samples on this page in a local development environment, install and initialize the gcloud CLI, and then set up Application Default Credentials with your user credentials. 

    1. [Install](https://docs.cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/install) the Google Cloud CLI. 

    2. If you're using an external identity provider (IdP), you must first [ sign in to the gcloud CLI with your federated identity](https://docs.cloud.google.com/iam/docs/workforce-log-in-gcloud). 

    3. If you're using a local shell, then create local authentication credentials for your user account: 
           
           gcloud auth application-default login

You don't need to do this if you're using Cloud Shell.

If an authentication error is returned, and you are using an external identity provider (IdP), confirm that you have [ signed in to the gcloud CLI with your federated identity](https://docs.cloud.google.com/iam/docs/workforce-log-in-gcloud). 

For more information, see [ Set up authentication for a local development environment](https://docs.cloud.google.com/compute/docs/authentication#local-development). 

### REST

To use the REST API samples on this page in a local development environment, you use the credentials you provide to the gcloud CLI. 

[Install](https://docs.cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/install) the Google Cloud CLI. 

If you're using an external identity provider (IdP), you must first [ sign in to the gcloud CLI with your federated identity](https://docs.cloud.google.com/iam/docs/workforce-log-in-gcloud). 

For more information, see [Authenticate for using REST](https://docs.cloud.google.com/docs/authentication/rest) in the Google Cloud authentication documentation. 




## Delete a custom image

Use one of the following methods to delete the image.

###  Console 

  1. In the Google Cloud console, go to the **Images** page.

[Go to Images](https://console.cloud.google.com/compute/images)

  2. Check the box to the left of the image you want to delete.

  3. Click **Delete** at the top of the page. Your image is deleted.




###  gcloud 

Use the [`gcloud compute images delete` command](https://docs.cloud.google.com/sdk/gcloud/reference/compute/images/delete) to delete an image:
    
    
    gcloud compute images delete IMAGE_NAME

Replace `IMAGE_NAME` with the name of the image to delete.

###  Go 
    
    
    import (
    	"context"
    	"fmt"
    	"io"
    
    	compute "cloud.google.com/go/compute/apiv1"
    	computepb "cloud.google.com/go/compute/apiv1/computepb"
    )
    
    // Deletes the specified disk image
    func deleteDiskImage(
    	w io.Writer,
    	projectID, imageName string,
    ) error {
    	// projectID := "your_project_id"
    	// imageName := "your_image"
    
    	ctx := context.Background()
    	imagesClient, err := compute.[NewImagesRESTClient](https://docs.cloud.google.com/go/docs/reference/cloud.google.com/go/compute/latest/apiv1.html#cloud_google_com_go_compute_apiv1_ImagesClient_NewImagesRESTClient)(ctx)
    	if err != nil {
    		return fmt.Errorf("NewImagesRESTClient: %w", err)
    	}
    	defer imagesClient.Close()
    
    	req := computepb.DeleteImageRequest{
    		Image:   imageName,
    		Project: projectID,
    	}
    
    	op, err := imagesClient.Delete(ctx, &req)
    
    	if err = op.Wait(ctx); err != nil {
    		return fmt.Errorf("unable to wait for the operation: %w", err)
    	}
    
    	fmt.Fprintf(w, "Disk image %s deleted\n", imageName)
    
    	return nil
    }

###  REST 

Make a `POST` request to the [`images().delete` method](https://docs.cloud.google.com/compute/docs/reference/rest/v1/images/delete). Specify the name of the image you want to delete.
    
    
    POST https://compute.googleapis.com/compute/v1/projects/PROJECT_ID/global/images/RESOURCE_ID

Replace the following:

  * `PROJECT_ID`: the project to which the image belongs.
  * `RESOURCE_ID`: the name of the image that you want to delete.
