#  Shielded VM overview Stay organized with collections  Save and categorize content based on your preferences. 

This page discusses key concepts and terminology for Shielded VM. To get started using Shielded VM, try the [quickstart](https://docs.cloud.google.com/compute/shielded-vm/docs/quickstart) or see [Modifying Shielded VM options](https://docs.cloud.google.com/compute/shielded-vm/docs/modifying-shielded-vm).

Shielded VM offers verifiable integrity of your Compute Engine VM instances, so you can be confident your instances haven't been compromised by boot- or kernel-level [malware](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malware) or [rootkits](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rootkit).

## Key benefits of Shielded VMs

Shielded VMs deliver multiple strategic advantages such as comprehensive protection against firmware-level attacks, bootloader modifications, and kernel-level compromises.

  * **Operational benefits:** include reduced security incident response time, simplified compliance management, and enhanced visibility into system integrity.

  * **Business advantages:** include increased confidence in cloud infrastructure, reduced risk of security breaches, and improved regulatory compliance posture.




## Core security architecture of Shielded VMs

Shielded VMs implement a triple shield architecture. This architecture provides robust protection from the ground up as described in the following table.

Feature | What it is | How it helps  
---|---|---  
Secure boot technology | A UEFI firmware feature that ensures your VM boots only with authentic, signed software by verifying the digital signature of all boot components such as firmware drivers, OS bootloader, and the kernel.   
For more information, see Secure boot. | Prevents unauthorized or tampered bootloaders and kernels from loading, stopping many bootkits and rootkits. Halts the boot process if a component lacks a trusted signature.   
Virtual trusted platform module (vTPM) | A virtualized security processor, providing each Shielded VM with a dedicated vTPM for hardware-level security.   
For more information, see Virtual trusted platform module (vTPM). |  Provides the following features: 

  * **Measured boot:** Takes cryptographic hashes of critical boot components such as firmware, bootloader, kernel, and drivers and stores them securely, creating a verifiable boot chain.
  * **Secure key generation and storage:** Generates and stores cryptographic keys, for example, for BitLocker, releasing them only if the measured boot verifies the boot state as trusted.

  
Advanced integrity monitoring | A monitoring system that establishes a golden baseline of boot measurements taken during the measured boot.   
For more information, see Integrity monitoring. | Compares current boot measurements against the trusted baseline on subsequent boots. Generates alerts in Cloud Logging and Security Command Center if it detects discrepancies, enabling proactive investigation of potential integrity violations.  
  
### Secure Boot

Secure Boot helps ensure that the system only runs authentic software by verifying the digital signature of all boot components, and halting the boot process if signature verification fails.

Shielded VM instances run Google-built UEFI firmware. As an additional layer of security, and in line with standard Google practices for all its production software, this firmware is cryptographically signed and verified using Google's internal Certificate Authority, and this validation is done on all firmware, regardless of whether the Secure Boot feature is enabled. This verification ensures the firmware's integrity, confirming it's authentic and unmodified and establishing the [root of trust](https://uefi.org/sites/default/files/resources/UEFI%20RoT%20white%20paper_Final%208%208%2016%20%28003%29.pdf) for Secure Boot.

The [Unified Extensible Firmware Interface (UEFI) 2.3.1 firmware](https://uefi.org/sites/default/files/resources/UEFI_Secure_Boot_in_Modern_Computer_Security_Solutions_2013.pdf), securely manages the certificates that contain the keys used by the software manufacturers to sign the system firmware, the system boot loader, and any binaries they load. Shielded VM instances use UEFI firmware.

On each boot, the UEFI firmware verifies the digital signature of each boot component against the secure store of approved keys. Any boot component that isn't properly signed, or isn't signed at all, isn't allowed to run.

If this occurs, the VM instance's [serial console](https://docs.cloud.google.com/compute/docs/instances/interacting-with-serial-console) log will have an entry containing the strings **UEFI: Failed to load image** and **Status: Security Violation** , along with a description of the boot option that failed. To troubleshoot the failure, disable Secure Boot by using the instructions in [Modifying Shielded VM options](https://docs.cloud.google.com/compute/shielded-vm/docs/modifying-shielded-vm) so that you can boot the VM instance, diagnose and resolve the issue, then re-enable Secure Boot.

### Virtual Trusted Platform Module (vTPM)

A vTPM is a virtualized [trusted platform module](https://trustedcomputinggroup.org/trusted-platform-module-tpm-summary/), which is a specialized computer chip you can use to protect objects, like keys and certificates, that you use to authenticate access to your system. The Shielded VM vTPM is fully compatible with the [Trusted Computing Group (TPM) library specification 2.0](https://trustedcomputinggroup.org/tpm-library-specification/) and uses the [BoringSSL library](https://boringssl.googlesource.com/boringssl/). The BoringSSL library relies on the BoringCrypto module. For FIPS 140-2 details about to the BoringCrypto module, see [NIST Cryptographic Module Validation Program Certificate #3678](https://csrc.nist.gov/projects/cryptographic-module-validation-program/certificate/3678).

The Shielded VM vTPM enables Measured Boot by performing the measurements needed to create a known good boot baseline, called the _integrity policy baseline_. The integrity policy baseline is used for comparison with measurements from subsequent VM boots to determine if anything has changed.

You can also use the vTPM to protect secrets through shielding or [sealing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trusted_Computing#SEALED-STORAGE). See the [Go-TPM](https://github.com/google/go-tpm) project on GitHub for Go language examples that illustrate how to use a vTPM for this purpose.

### Measured Boot

During Measured Boot, a hash of each component (for example, the firmware, bootloader, or kernel) is created as the component is loaded, and that hash is then concatenated and rehashed with the hashes of any components that have already been loaded, as illustrated here:

![Measured Boot process diagram](https://docs.cloud.google.com/static/compute/shielded-vm/images/measuredboot.png)

This information identifies both the components that were loaded, and their load order.

The first time you boot a VM instance, Measured Boot creates the integrity policy baseline from the first set of these measurements, and securely stores this data. Each time the VM instance boots after that, these measurements are taken again, and stored in secure memory until the next reboot. Having these two sets of measurements enables integrity monitoring, which you can use to determine if there have been changes to a VM instance's boot sequence.

### Integrity monitoring

Integrity monitoring helps you understand and make decisions about the state of your VM instances.

Integrity monitoring relies on the measurements created by Measured Boot, which use [platform configuration registers](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-1-4302-6584-9_12) (PCRs) to store information about the components and component load order of both the integrity policy baseline (a known good boot sequence), and the most recent boot sequence.

Integrity monitoring compares the most recent boot measurements to the integrity policy baseline and returns a pair of pass or fail results depending on whether they match or not, one for the early boot sequence and one for the late boot sequence. Early boot is the boot sequence from the start of the UEFI firmware until it passes control to the bootloader. Late boot is the boot sequence from the bootloader until it passes control to the operating system kernel. If either part of the most recent boot sequence doesn't match the baseline, you get an integrity validation failure.

If the failure is expected, for example if you applied a system update on that VM instance, you should [update the integrity policy baseline](https://docs.cloud.google.com/compute/shielded-vm/docs/integrity-monitoring#updating-baseline). Updating the integrity policy baseline sets the baseline to the measurements captured from the most recent boot sequence. If it is not expected, you should stop that VM instance and investigate the reason for the failure.

You can view integrity reports in Cloud Monitoring, and set alerts on integrity failures. You can review the details of integrity monitoring results in Cloud Logging. For more information, see [Monitoring integrity on Shielded VM instances](https://docs.cloud.google.com/compute/shielded-vm/docs/integrity-monitoring).

#### Integrity monitoring events

Shielded VM creates log entries for the following types of events:

  * `clearTPMEvent`: Identifies if the vTPM has been cleared, which deletes any secrets stored in it. This doesn't affect any aspect of Shielded VM, so you will only care about this if you use the vTPM to shield sensitive data as described in Virtual Trusted Platform Module (vTPM).
  * `earlyBootReportEvent`: Identifies whether the early boot sequence integrity check passed, and provides details on the PCR values from the baseline and the most recent boot sequence that were compared to make that determination.
  * `lateBootReportEvent`: Identifies whether the late boot sequence integrity check passed, and provides details on the PCR values from the baseline and the most recent boot sequence that were compared to make that determination.
  * `setShieldedInstanceIntegrityPolicy`: Logged each time you update the integrity policy baseline.
  * `shutdownEvent`: Logged each time the VM instance is stopped.
  * `startupEvent`: Logged each time the VM instance is started. The interesting information in this event is the `bootCounter` value, which identifies how many times this instance has been restarted.
  * `updateShieldedInstanceConfig`: Logged each time you enable or disable one of the Shielded VM options.



The typical event progression you see in the logs is `startupEvent`, `earlyBootReportEvent`, `lateBootReportEvent`, and eventually `shutdownEvent`, all with the same `bootCounter` value to identify them as describing the same VM instance boot sequence.

If you update the integrity policy baseline in response to an expected integrity failure on a VM instance, you will see additional `earlyBootReportEvent` and `lateBootReportEvent` events that describe the new integrity policy baseline measurements. The following example shows the expected sequence:

  * `startupEvent`
  * `earlyBootReportEvent` that compares original baseline to latest boot sequence (passes)
  * `lateBootReportEvent` that compares original baseline to latest boot sequence (fails)
  * `setShieldedInstanceIntegrityPolicy` when you [update the integrity policy baseline](https://docs.cloud.google.com/compute/shielded-vm/docs/integrity-monitoring#updating-baseline), which sets the baseline to the measurements captured from the latest boot sequence
  * `earlyBootReportEvent` that compares new baseline to latest boot sequence (passes)
  * `lateBootReportEvent` that compares new baseline to latest boot sequence (passes)




###  Windows 

#### earlyBootReportEvent

`earlyBootReportEvent` contains the following sections and elements:

  * `actualMeasurements`: Contains the [platform configuration register](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-1-4302-6584-9_12) (PCR) values for the latest boot sequence. The PCR values are what identify the boot components and component load order used by the latest boot sequence, and are what are compared to the integrity policy baseline (whose values are captured in the `policyMeasurements` section) to determine if there has been any change in the VM instance boot sequence. The elements of the `actualMeasurements` section can vary, based on the OS, distribution, and configuration. The section typically includes the following elements:

## Using BitLocker with Shielded VM images

You can enable BitLocker for Windows boot disks that are part of Shielded VM images. Shielded VM images offer security features such as UEFI-compliant firmware, Secure Boot, vTPM-protected Measured Boot, and integrity monitoring. vTPM and integrity monitoring are enabled by default, and Google recommends [enabling Secure Boot if possible](https://docs.cloud.google.com/compute/shielded-vm/docs/modifying-shielded-vm).

If you choose to enable BitLocker on a Windows boot disk that is part of a Shielded VM image, we strongly recommend saving the recovery key to a safe location, because if you don't have the recovery key, you can't recover the data.

Take the following into account before enabling BitLocker on a Windows boot disk that is part of a Shielded VM image:

  * On Shielded VM boot disks, BitLocker uses the vTPM to store the encryption keys, and the vTPM is permanently associated with the VM on which it was created. This means that you can restore a snapshot of a Shielded VM boot disk to another persistent disk, but you can't decrypt it because the vTPM containing the BitLocker keys isn't available. If you have a recovery key, you can recover data by following the instructions in the [BitLocker recovery guide](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/information-protection/bitlocker/bitlocker-recovery-guide-plan). If you don't have a recovery key, the data on the disk is unrecoverable.

  * On Shielded VM data disks, persistent disk data is encrypted by default. Enabling BitLocker on top of persistent disk encryption doesn't affect throughput, but it might increase vCPU utilization slightly. Enabling BitLocker on data disks that are attached to the VM doesn't pose the same recovery challenges as for boot disks. This is because the BitLocker encryption keys for data disks aren't stored on the vTPM. If you have lost the ability to unlock the disk normally and have the recovery key, you can attach the disk to another unencrypted VM and recover it from there. If you don't have a recovery key, the data on the disk is unrecoverable.




## Identity and Access Management authorization

Shielded VM uses IAM for authorization.

Shielded VM operations use the following Compute Engine permissions:

  * `compute.instances.updateShieldedInstanceConfig`: Allows the user to change the Shielded VM options on a VM instance.
  * `compute.instances.setShieldedInstanceIntegrityPolicy`: Allows the user to update the integrity policy baseline on a VM instance.
  * `compute.instances.getShieldedInstanceIdentity`: Allows the user to retrieve endorsement key information from the vTPM.



Shielded VM permissions are granted to the following Compute Engine roles:

  * `roles/compute.instanceAdmin.v1`
  * `roles/compute.securityAdmin`



You can also grant Shielded VM permissions to [custom roles](https://docs.cloud.google.com/iam/docs/creating-custom-roles).

## Organization policy constraints for Shielded VM

You can set the `constraints/compute.requireShieldedVm` [organization policy constraint](https://docs.cloud.google.com/resource-manager/docs/organization-policy/org-policy-constraints) to `True` to require that Compute Engine VM instances created in your organization be Shielded VM instances.

Learn how to set the `constraints/compute.requireShieldedVm` constraint in [Using boolean constraints in organization policy](https://docs.cloud.google.com/resource-manager/docs/organization-policy/using-constraints#boolean-constraint). You must be an [organization policy administrator](https://docs.cloud.google.com/resource-manager/docs/organization-policy/using-constraints#add-org-policy-admin) to set a constraint.

## Limitations

Shielded VM isn't supported on [bare-metal instances](https://docs.cloud.google.com/compute/docs/machine-resource#bare-metal-types) with the exception of A4X and C4A bare metal instances.

## What's next

  * Learn about [retrieving the endorsement key from the vTPM](https://docs.cloud.google.com/compute/shielded-vm/docs/retrieving-endorsement-key).
  * Learn about one approach to [automating responses to integrity monitoring events](https://docs.cloud.google.com/compute/shielded-vm/docs/automating-responses-integrity-failures).
