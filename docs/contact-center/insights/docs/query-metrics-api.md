#  Query metrics Stay organized with collections  Save and categorize content based on your preferences. 

**Preview**

This feature is subject to the "Pre-GA Offerings Terms" in the General Service Terms section of the [Service Specific Terms](https://docs.cloud.google.com/terms/service-terms#1). Pre-GA features are available "as is" and might have limited support. For more information, see the [launch stage descriptions](https://cloud.google.com/products/#product-launch-stages). 

Query metrics about the conversation data that you have in CX Insights. These metrics include, for example, the total conversation count, average silence percentage, and average conversation duration.

## Prerequisites

[Contact your Google representative](https://docs.cloud.google.com/gemini-enterprise-cx/insights/getting-support) to enable this feature in your project.

## Query metrics

The following code sample demonstrates how to query metrics. A conversation create time filter is always required. Reference [list conversations](https://docs.cloud.google.com/gemini-enterprise-cx/insights/list-conversations-api) for more information about this filter.

### All metrics

Get all metrics.

### REST

Before using any of the request data, make the following replacements: 

  * PROJECT_ID: your project ID.
  * MIN_TIMESTAMP: a minimum timestamp filter. For example, `YYYY-MM-DDT00:00:00+00`
  * MAX_TIMESTAMP: a maximum timestamp filter. For example, `YYYY-MM-DDT00:00:00+00`
**Note:** All the examples are using the global Customer Experience Insights instance. Refer to [Regionalization](https://docs.cloud.google.com/gemini-enterprise-cx/insights/docs/regionalization) for instructions on using regional instances. 


HTTP method and URL: 
    
    
    GET https://contactcenterinsights.googleapis.com/v1/projects/PROJECT_ID/locations/us-central1:queryMetrics

Request JSON body: 
    
    
    {
      "filter": "create_time>='MIN_TIMESTAMP' create_time<'MAX_TIMESTAMP'"
    }
    

To send your request, expand one of these options:

#### curl (Linux, macOS, or Cloud Shell)

**Note:** The following command assumes that you have logged in to the `gcloud` CLI with your user account by running [`gcloud init`](https://docs.cloud.google.com/sdk/gcloud/reference/init) or [`gcloud auth login`](https://docs.cloud.google.com/sdk/gcloud/reference/auth/login) , or by using [Cloud Shell](https://docs.cloud.google.com/shell/docs), which automatically logs you into the `gcloud` CLI . You can check the currently active account by running [`gcloud auth list`](https://docs.cloud.google.com/sdk/gcloud/reference/auth/list). 

Save the request body in a file named `request.json`, and execute the following command: 
    
    
    curl -X GET \  
         -H "Authorization: Bearer $(gcloud auth print-access-token)" \  
         -H "Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8" \  
         -d @request.json \  
         "https://contactcenterinsights.googleapis.com/v1/projects/PROJECT_ID/locations/us-central1:queryMetrics"

#### PowerShell (Windows)

**Note:** The following command assumes that you have logged in to the `gcloud` CLI with your user account by running [`gcloud init`](https://docs.cloud.google.com/sdk/gcloud/reference/init) or [`gcloud auth login`](https://docs.cloud.google.com/sdk/gcloud/reference/auth/login) . You can check the currently active account by running [`gcloud auth list`](https://docs.cloud.google.com/sdk/gcloud/reference/auth/list). 

Save the request body in a file named `request.json`, and execute the following command: 
    
    
    $cred = gcloud auth print-access-token  
    $headers = @{ "Authorization" = "Bearer $cred" }  
      
    Invoke-WebRequest `  
        -Method GET `  
        -Headers $headers `  
        -ContentType: "application/json; charset=utf-8" `  
        -InFile request.json `  
        -Uri "https://contactcenterinsights.googleapis.com/v1/projects/PROJECT_ID/locations/us-central1:queryMetrics" | Select-Object -Expand Content

You should receive a JSON response similar to the following:
    
    
    {
      "name": "projects/PROJECT_ID/locations/us-central1/operations/OPERATION_ID",
      "metadata": {
        "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.cloud.contactcenterinsights.v1.QueryMetricsMetadata"
      }
    }
