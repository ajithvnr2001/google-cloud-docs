# Fleet management with custom organization policies

You can use the [Organization Policy Service](https://docs.cloud.google.com/resource-manager/docs/organization-policy/overview) with [custom constraints](https://docs.cloud.google.com/managed-spark/docs/concepts/custom-constraints) to enforce specific configurations across your organization's Managed Service for Apache Spark clusters. This centralized approach helps ensure compliance, control costs, and standardize your Managed Service for Apache Spark fleet.

This guide shows you how to create and enforce a custom organization policy for Managed Service for Apache Spark clusters. For more information, see the [Introduction to the Organization Policy](https://docs.cloud.google.com/resource-manager/docs/organization-policy/overview).

## Before you begin

  1. Sign in to your Google Cloud account. If you're new to Google Cloud, [ create an account](https://console.cloud.google.com/freetrial) to evaluate how our products perform in real-world scenarios. New customers also get $300 in free credits to run, test, and deploy workloads. 
  2. In the Google Cloud console, on the project selector page, select or create a Google Cloud project.

**Roles required to select or create a project**

     * **Select a project** : Selecting a project doesn't require a specific IAM role—you can select any project that you've been granted a role on. 
     * **Create a project** : To create a project, you need the Project Creator role (`roles/resourcemanager.projectCreator`), which contains the `resourcemanager.projects.create` permission. [Learn how to grant roles](https://docs.cloud.google.com/iam/docs/granting-changing-revoking-access). 
**Note** : If you don't plan to keep the resources that you create in this procedure, create a project instead of selecting an existing project. After you finish these steps, you can delete the project, removing all resources associated with the project.

[Go to project selector](https://console.cloud.google.com/projectselector2/home/dashboard)

  3. [Verify that billing is enabled for your Google Cloud project](https://docs.cloud.google.com/billing/docs/how-to/verify-billing-enabled#confirm_billing_is_enabled_on_a_project). 

  4. Enable the Resource Manager API, if it is not already enabled. 

**Roles required to enable APIs**

To enable APIs, you need the `serviceusage.services.enable` permission. If you created the project, then you likely already have this permission through the Owner role (`roles/owner`). Otherwise, you can get this permission through the Service Usage Admin role (`roles/serviceusage.serviceUsageAdmin`). [Learn how to grant roles](https://docs.cloud.google.com/iam/docs/granting-changing-revoking-access). 

[Enable the API](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/enableflow?apiid=cloudresourcemanager.googleapis.com)

  5. Make sure that you have the following role or roles on the project: Organization Policy Administrator 

#### Check for the roles

     1. In the Google Cloud console, go to the **IAM** page. 

[Go to IAM](https://console.cloud.google.com/projectselector/iam-admin/iam?supportedpurview=project)
     2. Select the project. 
     3. In the **Principal** column, find all rows that identify you or a group that you're included in. To learn which groups you're included in, contact your administrator. 

     4. For all rows that specify or include you, check the **Role** column to see whether the list of roles includes the required roles. 

#### Grant the roles

     1. In the Google Cloud console, go to the **IAM** page. 

[Go to IAM](https://console.cloud.google.com/projectselector/iam-admin/iam?supportedpurview=project)
     2. Select the project. 
     3. Click person_add **Grant access**. 
     4. In the **New principals** field, enter your user identifier. This is typically the email address for a Google Account.

     5. Click **Select a role** , then search for the role. 
     6. To grant additional roles, click add **Add another role** and add each additional role. 
     7. Click **Save**. 
  6. [Install](https://docs.cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/install) the Google Cloud CLI. 

**Note:** If you installed the gcloud CLI previously, make sure you have the latest version by running `gcloud components update`. 
  7. If you're using an external identity provider (IdP), you must first [ sign in to the gcloud CLI with your federated identity](https://docs.cloud.google.com/iam/docs/workforce-log-in-gcloud). 

  8. To [initialize](https://docs.cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/initializing) the gcloud CLI, run the following command: 
         
         gcloud init

  9. In the Google Cloud console, on the project selector page, select or create a Google Cloud project.

     * **Select a project** : Selecting a project doesn't require a specific IAM role—you can select any project that you've been granted a role on.

         gcloud init




## Enforce a custom constraint

The following steps show you how to enforce a common security requirement: ensuring that all new Managed Service for Apache Spark clusters have Kerberos enabled.

  1. Define the custom constraint.

     1. Create a YAML file with the following content:
    
    name: organizations/ORGANIZATION_ID/customConstraints/custom.dataprocKerberos
    resourceTypes:
    -   dataproc.googleapis.com/Cluster
    methodTypes:
    -   CREATE
    condition: "resource.config.securityConfig.kerberosConfig.enableKerberos == true"
    actionType: ALLOW
    displayName: Cluster must have Kerberos enabled.
    

Replace `ORGANIZATION_ID` with your organization ID.

  2. Set the custom constraint to make it available to your organization.
         
         gcloud org-policies set-custom-constraint CONSTRAINT_PATH
         

Replace `CONSTRAINT_PATH` with the path to your YAML constraint file.

  3. Create an organization policy that enforces the constraint.

     1. Create another YAML file with the following content:
    
    name: projects/PROJECT_ID/policies/custom.dataprocKerberos
    spec:
      rules:
        -   enforce: true
    

Replace `PROJECT_ID` with the ID of the project to apply the policy to. You can also apply this policy at a folder or organization level.

  4. Apply the policy.
         
         gcloud org-policies set-policy POLICY_PATH
         

Replace `POLICY_PATH` with the path to the YAML policy file.




After you apply the policy, an attempt to create a Managed Service for Apache Spark cluster in the specified resource without Kerberos enabled fails.

**Note:** The policy can take up to 15 minutes to propagate.

## Use cases for custom constraints

You can create custom constraints to enforce a wide range of policies for your Managed Service for Apache Spark fleet. Applying fleet policies helps with cost control, standardization, and security.

Example: You can require specific machine types or prevent public IP addresses on cluster nodes.
