    use Google\Cloud\Redis\Cluster\V1\Client\CloudRedisClusterClient;
    use Google\Cloud\Redis\Cluster\V1\GetBackupRequest;
    
    // Create a client.
    $cloudRedisClusterClient = new CloudRedisClusterClient();
    
    // Prepare the request message.
    $request = (new GetBackupRequest())
        ->setName($formattedName);
    
    // Call the API and handle any network failures.
    try {
        /** @var Backup $response */
        $response = $cloudRedisClusterClient->getBackup($request);
        printf('Response data: %s' . PHP_EOL, $response->serializeToJsonString());
    } catch (ApiException $ex) {
