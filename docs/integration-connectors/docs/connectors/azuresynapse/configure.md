# Azure Synapse

The Azure Synapse connector lets you connect to a Azure Synapse SQL pools and use SQL to retrieve and update the Azure Synapse data. 

## Before you begin

Before using the Azure Synapse connector, do the following tasks:

  * In your Google Cloud project: 
    * Ensure that network connectivity is set up. For information about network patterns, see [Network connectivity](https://docs.cloud.google.com/integration-connectors/docs/network-connectivity-private). 
    * Grant the [roles/connectors.admin](https://docs.cloud.google.com/integration-connectors/docs/connectors-access-permissions#iam-roles-for-integration-connectors) IAM role to the user configuring the connector.
    * Grant the following IAM roles to the service account that you want to use for the connector: 
      * `roles/secretmanager.viewer`
      * `roles/secretmanager.secretAccessor`

A service account is a special type of Google account intended to represent a non-human user that needs to authenticate and be authorized to access data in Google APIs. If you don't have a service account, you must create a service account. The connector and the service account must belong to the same project. For more information, see [Creating a service account](https://docs.cloud.google.com/iam/docs/creating-managing-service-accounts#creating). 

    * Enable the following services: 
      * `secretmanager.googleapis.com` (Secret Manager API)
      * `connectors.googleapis.com` (Connectors API)

To understand how to enable services, see [Enabling services](https://docs.cloud.google.com/service-usage/docs/enable-disable#enabling).

If these services or permissions have not been enabled for your project previously, you are prompted to enable them when configuring the connector. 




## Configure the connector

A connection is specific to a data source. It means that if you have many data sources, you must create a separate connection for each data source. To create a connection, do the following:

  1. In the [Cloud console](https://console.cloud.google.com), go to the **Integration Connectors > Connections** page and then select or create a Google Cloud project. 

[ Go to the Connections page ](https://console.cloud.google.com/connectors/connections)

  2. Click **\+ Create new** to open the **Create Connection** page.
  3. In the **Location** section, choose the location for the connection. 
     1. **Region** : Select a location from the drop-down list. 

Supported regions for connectors include: 

For the list of all the supported regions, see [Locations](https://docs.cloud.google.com/integration-connectors/docs/locations).

     2. Click **Next**.
  4. In the **Connection Details** section, complete the following: 
     1. **Connector** : Select **Azure Synapse** from the drop down list of available Connectors.
     2. **Connector version** : Select the Connector version from the drop down list of available versions. 
     3. In the **Connection Name** field, enter a name for the Connection instance. 

Connection names must meet the following criteria: 

        * Connection names can use letters, numbers, or hyphens.
        * Letters must be lower-case.
        * Connection names must begin with a letter and end with a letter or number.
        * Connection names cannot exceed 49 characters.
     4. Optionally, enter a Description for the connection instance.
     5. **Service Account** : Select a service account that has the required roles.
     6. Optionally, configure the **Connection node settings** : 

        * **Minimum number of nodes** : Enter the minimum number of connection nodes.
        * **Maximum number of nodes** : Enter the maximum number of connection nodes.

A node is a unit (or replica) of a connection that processes transactions. More nodes are required to process more transactions for a connection and conversely, fewer nodes are required to process fewer transactions. To understand how the nodes affect your connector pricing, see [ Pricing for connection nodes](https://docs.cloud.google.com/integration-connectors/docs/pricing#pricing-for-connection-nodes). If you don't enter any values, by default the minimum nodes are set to 2 (for better availability) and the maximum nodes are set to 50.

**Note:** You can customize the connection node values only if you are a Pay-as-you-go customer.
     7. **Azure Tenant** : This property specifies The Microsoft Azure tenant being used to access data. 
     8. **Database** : This property specifies The name of the Synapse database in the serverless sql pool or dedicated sql pool . 
     9. Under Destinations enter the following properties:
        * **Destination Type** : Select Host Addrress from drop down
        * **Host 1** : Enter sql pool endpoint
        * **Port 1** : Enter the port for the sql endpoint
. 
     10. Optionally enter the following properties for SSL: 
        * **Enable SSL** : This checkbox property specifies whether to enable SSL.
        * **Trust Store** : This property specifies the trust store. You can select a radio button to select the trust store from Pubic, Private or Insecure Connection.
        * **Custom Trust Store** : This property is used to select a secret containing the custom trust store in PEM format.
        * **SSL Client Certificate** : This property specifies the SSL client certificate.
        * **SSL Client Private Key** : This property specifies the SSL client private key in PEM format.
        * **SSL Client Certificate Key Passphrase** : This property specifies the SSL client private key passphrase.
     11. Optionally, click **\+ Add label** to add a label to the Connection in the form of a key/value pair.
     12. Click **Next**.
  5. In the **Authentication** section, enter the authentication details. 
     1. Select an **Authentication type** and enter the relevant details. 

The following authentication types are supported by the Azure Synapse connection:

        * User Password 
        * Azure AD 

To understand how to configure these authentication types, see Configure authentication.

     2. Click **Next**.
  6. **Review** : Review your connection and authentication details.
  7. Click **Create**.



### Configure authentication

Enter the details based on the authentication you want to use.

  * **User Password**
    * **User Name** : Enter the database username.
    * **Password** : Secret Manager Secret containing the password associated with the user name.


  * **Azure AD**
    * **Client ID** : The client ID used for requesting access tokens. This can be found in the overview of the connected app created in the Azure portal. 
    * **Scope** :A comma-separated list of desired scopes.
    * **Client Secret** : Secret Manager Secret containing the Account Access Key.
    * **Authorization URL** : The authorization URL that you generate when you create an OAuth client. Enter the URL in the following format: `https://login.microsoftonline.com/TENANT_IDENTIFIER/oauth2/v2.0/authorize?prompt=consent`. For example, `https://login.microsoftonline.com/9bxxxxxxxxx8112/oauth2/v2.0/authorize?prompt=consent`. 



### Additional steps after connection creation

If you selected `OAuth 2.0 - Authorization code` for authentication, you must do the following additional steps after creating the connection:

  1. In the [Connections page](https://console.cloud.google.com/connectors/connections), locate the newly created connection. 

Notice that the **Status** for the new connector will be **Authorization required**.

  2. Click **Authorization required**. 

This shows the **Edit authorization** pane.

  3. Copy the **Redirect URI** value to your external application.
  4. Verify the authorization details.
  5. Click **Authorize**. 

If the authorization is successful, the connection status will be set to **Active** in the [Connections page](https://console.cloud.google.com/connectors/connections).




## Re-authorization for authorization code

If you are using `Authorization code` authentication type and have made any cofiguration changes in your Azure Synapse application, you must re-authorize your Azure Synapse connection. To re-authorize a connection, perform the following steps:

  1. Click on the required connection in the [Connections page](https://console.cloud.google.com/connectors/connections). 

This opens the connection details page.

  2. Click **Edit** to edit the connection details. 
  3. Verify the **OAuth 2.0 - Authorization code** details in the **Authentication** section. 

If required, make the necessary changes.

  4. Click **Save**. This takes you to the connection details page.
  5. Click **Edit authorization** in the **Authentication** section. This shows the **Authorize** pane.
  6. Click **Authorize**. 

If the authorization is successful, the connection status will be set to **Active** in the [Connections page](https://console.cloud.google.com//connectors/connections).




## Entities, operations, and actions

All the Integration Connectors provide a layer of abstraction for the objects of the connected application. You can access an application's objects only through this abstraction. The abstraction is exposed to you as entities, operations, and actions.

**Note:** You can view the entities, operations, and actions of a connector in the [Connectors task](https://docs.cloud.google.com/application-integration/docs/connectors-task).

  * **Entity:** An entity can be thought of as an object, or a collection of properties, in the connected application or service. The definition of an entity differs from a connector to a connector. For example, in a database connector, tables are the entities, in a file server connector, folders are the entities, and in a messaging system connector, queues are the entities. 

However, it is possible that a connector doesn't support or have any entities, in which case the `Entities` list will be empty.

  * **Operation:** An operation is the activity that you can perform on an entity. You can perform any of the following operations on an entity: 
    * [List](https://docs.cloud.google.com/application-integration/docs/configure-connectors-task#config-prop)
    * [Get](https://docs.cloud.google.com/application-integration/docs/configure-connectors-task#config-prop)
    * [Create](https://docs.cloud.google.com/application-integration/docs/configure-connectors-task#config-prop)
    * [Update](https://docs.cloud.google.com/application-integration/docs/configure-connectors-task#config-prop)
    * [Delete](https://docs.cloud.google.com/application-integration/docs/configure-connectors-task#config-prop)

Selecting an entity from the available list, generates a list of operations available for the entity. For a detailed description of the operations, see the Connectors task's [entity operations](https://docs.cloud.google.com/application-integration/docs/connectors-task#config-prop). However, if a connector doesn't support any of the entity operations, such unsupported operations aren't listed in the `Operations` list.

  * **Action:** An action is a first class function that is made available to the integration through the connector interface. An action lets you make changes to an entity or entities, and vary from connector to connector. Normally, an action will have some input parameters, and an output parameter. However, it is possible that a connector doesn't support any action, in which case the `Actions` list will be empty. 

**Note:** All entities and actions will have a schema associated with them. For example, an action schema will have the parameter details such as; the parameter names, and its corresponding data type. The schema (metadata) for entities and actions is fetched by the connection at runtime from your backend. If there are any updates to the schema, such updates won't be automatically reflected in your existing connections; you must manually refresh the schema. To refresh the schema for a connection, open the **Connection details** page of the connection, and then click **Refresh connection schema**. 

## System limitations

The Azure Synapse connector can process a maximum of 4 transactions per second, per [node](https://docs.cloud.google.com/integration-connectors/docs/pricing#payg), and [throttles](https://docs.cloud.google.com/integration-connectors/docs/rate-limiting) any transactions beyond this limit. By default, Integration Connectors allocates 2 nodes (for better availability) for a connection. 

For information on the limits applicable to Integration Connectors, see [Limits](https://docs.cloud.google.com/integration-connectors/docs/quotas).

**Note:** The number of [Integration Connectors nodes](https://docs.cloud.google.com/integration-connectors/docs/pricing#pricing-for-connection-nodes) will autoscale dynamically based on your usage. However, if you want to reserve capacity for large volumes without waiting for autoscaling, you can adjust the minimum node value for a connection. More nodes are required to process more transactions for a connection. Conversely, fewer nodes are required if a connection processes fewer transactions. To configure the node values, do the following: 

  * If you are a pay-as-you-go customer, configure the minimum and maximum node value in the edit connection page. 
  * If you are a subscription based customer, [contact support](https://docs.cloud.google.com/integration-connectors/docs/getting-support).



The maximum transactions that a node can handle depends on various factors. So, before adjusting the minimum nodes for better throughput, it is recommended you check if your backend systems are set up optimally to handle the required traffic.

## Actions

The Azure Synapse connector lets you execute your stored procedures and custom SQL queries in the format supported by your Azure Synapse. To execute custom SQL queries, the connector provides the **Execute custom query** action.

To create a custom query, follow these steps: 

  1. Follow the detailed instructions to [ add a connectors task](https://docs.cloud.google.com/application-integration/docs/configure-connectors-task#add-a-connectors-task).
  2. When you [configure the connector task](https://docs.cloud.google.com/application-integration/docs/configure-connectors-task#configure-the-connectors-task), in the type of action you want to perform, select **Actions**.
  3. In the **Action** list, select **Execute custom query** , and then click **Done**. 

![image showing execute-custom-query-action](https://docs.cloud.google.com/static/application-integration/images/execute-custom-query-action.png)![image showing execute-custom-query-action](https://docs.cloud.google.com/static/application-integration/images/execute-custom-query-action.png)

  4. Expand the **Task input** section, and then do the following: 
     1. In the **Timeout after** field, enter the number of seconds to wait till the query executes. 

Default value: `180` seconds.

     2. In the **Maximum number of rows** field, enter the maximum number of rows to be returned from the database.

Default value: `25`.

     3. To update the custom query, click **Edit Custom Script**. The **Script editor** dialog opens. 

![image showing custom-sql-query](https://docs.cloud.google.com/static/application-integration/images/add-custom-sql-query.png)![image showing custom-sql-query](https://docs.cloud.google.com/static/application-integration/images/add-custom-sql-query.png)

     4. In the **Script editor** dialog, enter the SQL query and click **Save**. 

You can use a question mark (?) in a SQL statement to represent a single parameter that must be specified in the query parameters list. For example, the following SQL query selects all rows from the `Employees` table that matches the values specified for the `LastName` column: 
            
            SELECT * FROM Employees where LastName=?

**Note:** Data manipulation language (DML) and data definition language (DDL) statements are supported.
     5. If you've used question marks in your SQL query, you must add the parameter by clicking **\+ Add Parameter Name** for each question mark. While executing the integration, these parameters replace the question marks (?) in the SQL query sequentially. For example, if you have added three question marks (?), then you must add three parameters in order of sequence. 

![image showing add-query-param](https://docs.cloud.google.com/static/application-integration/images/add-query-param.png)![image showing add-query-param](https://docs.cloud.google.com/static/application-integration/images/add-query-param.png)

To add query parameters, do the following:

        1. From the **Type** list, select the data type of the parameter.
        2. In the **Value** field, enter the value of the parameter.
        3. To add multiple parameters, click **\+ Add Query Parameter**.

The **Execute custom query** action does not support array variables.




## Entity operation examples

### Example - List records of an entity

This example lists the records of the `Users` entity.

  1. In the `Configure connector task` dialog, click `Entities`.
  2. Select `Users` from the `Entity` list.
  3. Select the `List` operation, and then click **Done**.
  4. In the **Task Input** section of the **Connectors** task, you can set the **filterClause** as per your requirement. 

For example, setting the filter clause to `employeeCode='5100' and startDate='2010-01-01 00:00:00'`, lists only those records whose employeeCode is 5100 and startDate is 2010-01-01 00:00:00.




### Example - Get a single record from an entity

This example fetches a record from the `Users` entity.

  1. In the `Configure connector task` dialog, click `Entities`.
  2. Select `User` from the `Entity` list.
  3. Select the `Get` operation, and then click **Done**.
  4. In the **Task Input** section of the **Connectors** task, click **entityId** and then enter `103032` in the **Default Value** field. 

Here, `103032` is the primary key value of the `Users` entity.




### Example - Delete a record from an entity

This example deletes a record from the `Users` entity.

  1. In the `Configure connector task` dialog, click `Entities`.
  2. Select `Users` from the `Entity` list.
  3. Select the `Delete` operation, and then click **Done**.
  4. In the **Task Input** section of the **Connectors** task, click **entityId** and then enter `113132` in the **Default Value** field. 

Alternately, if the entity has composite primary keys instead of specifying the **entityId** , you can set the **filterClause**. For example, `employeeCode='5100' and startDate='2010-01-01 00:00:00'`.




### Example - Create a record in an entity

This example creates a record in the `Users` entity.

  1. In the `Configure connector task` dialog, click `Entities`.
  2. Select `Users` from the `Entity` list.
  3. Select the `Create` operation, and then click **Done**.
  4. In the **Task Input** section of the **Connectors** task, click `connectorInputPayload` and then enter a value similar to the following in the `Default Value` field: 
         
         {
         "employeeCode": "5100",
         "startDate": "2010-01-01 00:00:00.0",
         "country": "US"
         }

If the integration is successful, the connector task's `connectorOutputPayload` field will have the response of the create operation.




### Example - Update a record in an entity

This example updates a record in the `Users` entity.

  1. In the `Configure connector task` dialog, click `Entities`.
  2. Select `Users` from the `Entity` list.
  3. Select the `Update` operation, and then click **Done**.
  4. In the **Task Input** section of the **Connectors** task, click `connectorInputPayload` and then enter a value similar to the following in the `Default Value` field: 
         
         {
         "country": "IN"
         }

  5. In the **Task Input** section of the **Connectors** task, click **entityId** and then enter `113132` in the **Default Value** field. 

Alternately, if the entity has composite primary keys instead of specifying the **entityId** , you can set the **filterClause**. For example, `employeeCode='5100' and startDate='2010-01-01 00:00:00'`.

If the integration is successful, the connector task's `connectorOutputPayload` field will have the response of the update operation.
