# Dataverse

The Dataverse connector lets you perform insert, delete, update, and read operations on Custom Tables.

## Before you begin

Before using the Dataverse connector, do the following tasks:

  * In your Google Cloud project: 
    * Ensure that network connectivity is set up. For information about network patterns, see [Network connectivity](https://docs.cloud.google.com/integration-connectors/docs/network-connectivity-private). 
    * Grant the [roles/connectors.admin](https://docs.cloud.google.com/integration-connectors/docs/connectors-access-permissions#iam-roles-for-integration-connectors) IAM role to the user configuring the connector.
    * Grant the following IAM roles to the service account that you want to use for the connector: 
      * `roles/secretmanager.viewer`
      * `roles/secretmanager.secretAccessor`

A service account is a special type of Google account intended to represent a non-human user that needs to authenticate and be authorized to access data in Google APIs. If you don't have a service account, you must create a service account. The connector and the service account must belong to the same project. For more information, see [Creating a service account](https://docs.cloud.google.com/iam/docs/creating-managing-service-accounts#creating). 

    * Enable the following services: 
      * `secretmanager.googleapis.com` (Secret Manager API)
      * `connectors.googleapis.com` (Connectors API)

To understand how to enable services, see [Enabling services](https://docs.cloud.google.com/service-usage/docs/enable-disable#enabling).

If these services or permissions have not been enabled for your project previously, you are prompted to enable them when configuring the connector. 




## Configure the connector

A connection is specific to a data source. It means that if you have many data sources, you must create a separate connection for each data source. To create a connection, do the following:

  1. In the [Cloud console](https://console.cloud.google.com), go to the **Integration Connectors > Connections** page and then select or create a Google Cloud project. 

[ Go to the Connections page ](https://console.cloud.google.com/connectors/connections)

  2. Click **\+ CREATE NEW** to open the **Create Connection** page.
  3. In the **Location** section, choose the location for the connection. 
     1. **Region** : Select a location from the drop-down list. 

For the list of all the supported regions, see [Locations](https://docs.cloud.google.com/integration-connectors/docs/locations).

     2. Click **NEXT**.
  4. In the **Connection Details** section, complete the following: 
     1. **Connector** : Select **Dataverse** from the drop down list of available Connectors.
     2. **Connector version** : Select the Connector version from the drop down list of available versions. 
     3. In the **Connection Name** field, enter a name for the Connection instance. 

Connection names must meet the following criteria: 

        * Connection names can use letters, numbers, or hyphens.
        * Letters must be lower-case.
        * Connection names must begin with a letter and end with a letter or number.
        * Connection names cannot exceed 49 characters.
     4. Optionally, enter a **Description** for the connection instance.
     5. Optionally, enable [Cloud logging](https://docs.cloud.google.com/integration-connectors/docs/view-connector-logs), and then select a log level. By default, the log level is set to `Error`. 
     6. **Service Account** : Select a service account that has the required roles.
     7. Optionally, configure the **Connection node settings** : 

        * **Minimum number of nodes** : Enter the minimum number of connection nodes.
        * **Maximum number of nodes** : Enter the maximum number of connection nodes.

A node is a unit (or replica) of a connection that processes transactions. More nodes are required to process more transactions for a connection and conversely, fewer nodes are required to process fewer transactions. To understand how the nodes affect your connector pricing, see [ Pricing for connection nodes](https://docs.cloud.google.com/integration-connectors/docs/pricing#pricing-for-connection-nodes). If you don't enter any values, by default the minimum nodes are set to 2 (for better availability) and the maximum nodes are set to 50.

**Note:** You can customize the connection node values only if you are a Pay-as-you-go customer.
     8. **Azure Tenant** : The Microsoft Online tenant being used to access data. If not specified, your default tentant will be used. 
     9. **Organization URL** : The URL to your Microsoft Dataverse data. For instance, https://abc123.crm.dynamics.com/. 
     10. **Tenant** : The Microsoft tenant being used to access data. If not specified, your default tenant is used. 
     11. Optionally, in the **API version** field, specify the API version to use. If a new version of the API is released, you can specify that version in this field. 
     12. Optionally, to enable the provider to use display names for operations, select **Use Display Names**. 
     13. **Schema** : Select the schema to use. 
     14. Optionally, click **\+ Add label** to add a label to the Connection in the form of a key/value pair.
     15. In the **SSL Configuration** section, select a trust model: 
        * **Public** : Public certificates picked from the default trust store.
        * **Private** : Self-signed certificates or certificates issued by private certificate authorities
        * **Insecure Connection** : Trust all certificates. We recommend using either a public or private trust model.
  5. In the **Authentication** section, enter the authentication details. To understand how to configure these authentication types, see Configure authentication. 
  6. Click **Next**.
  7. **Review** : Review your connection and authentication details.
  8. Click **Create**.



### Configure authentication

Enter the details based on the authentication you want to use.

  * **Client ID** : The client ID used for requesting access tokens.
  * **Scope** : A comma-separated list of desired scopes.
  * **Client secret** : The client secret used for requesting access tokens.
  * **Authorization URL** : Authorization URL generated when creating client.



## System limitations

The Dataverse connector can process 25 transactions per second, per [node](https://docs.cloud.google.com/integration-connectors/docs/pricing#payg), and [throttles](https://docs.cloud.google.com/integration-connectors/docs/rate-limiting) any transactions beyond this limit. By default, Integration Connectors allocates 2 nodes (for better availability) for a connection. 

For information on the limits applicable to Integration Connectors, see [Limits](https://docs.cloud.google.com/integration-connectors/docs/quotas).

**Note:** The number of [Integration Connectors nodes](https://docs.cloud.google.com/integration-connectors/docs/pricing#pricing-for-connection-nodes) will autoscale dynamically based on your usage. However, if you want to reserve capacity for large volumes without waiting for autoscaling, you can adjust the minimum node value for a connection. More nodes are required to process more transactions for a connection. Conversely, fewer nodes are required if a connection processes fewer transactions. To configure the node values, do the following: 

  * If you are a pay-as-you-go customer, configure the minimum and maximum node value in the edit connection page. 
  * If you are a subscription based customer, [contact support](https://docs.cloud.google.com/integration-connectors/docs/getting-support).



The maximum transactions that a node can handle depends on various factors. So, before adjusting the minimum nodes for better throughput, it is recommended you check if your backend systems are set up optimally to handle the required traffic.

## Entities, operations, and actions

All the Integration Connectors provide a layer of abstraction for the objects of the connected application. You can access an application's objects only through this abstraction. The abstraction is exposed to you as entities, operations, and actions.

**Note:** You can view the entities, operations, and actions of a connector in the [Connectors task](https://docs.cloud.google.com/application-integration/docs/connectors-task).

  * **Entity:** An entity can be thought of as an object, or a collection of properties, in the connected application or service. The definition of an entity differs from a connector to a connector. For example, in a database connector, tables are the entities, in a file server connector, folders are the entities, and in a messaging system connector, queues are the entities. 

However, it is possible that a connector doesn't support or have any entities, in which case the `Entities` list will be empty.

  * **Operation:** An operation is the activity that you can perform on an entity. You can perform any of the following operations on an entity: 
    * [List](https://docs.cloud.google.com/application-integration/docs/configure-connectors-task#config-prop)
    * [Get](https://docs.cloud.google.com/application-integration/docs/configure-connectors-task#config-prop)
    * [Create](https://docs.cloud.google.com/application-integration/docs/configure-connectors-task#config-prop)
    * [Update](https://docs.cloud.google.com/application-integration/docs/configure-connectors-task#config-prop)
    * [Delete](https://docs.cloud.google.com/application-integration/docs/configure-connectors-task#config-prop)

Selecting an entity from the available list, generates a list of operations available for the entity. For a detailed description of the operations, see the Connectors task's [entity operations](https://docs.cloud.google.com/application-integration/docs/connectors-task#config-prop). However, if a connector doesn't support any of the entity operations, such unsupported operations aren't listed in the `Operations` list.

  * **Action:** An action is a first class function that is made available to the integration through the connector interface. An action lets you make changes to an entity or entities, and vary from connector to connector. Normally, an action will have some input parameters, and an output parameter. However, it is possible that a connector doesn't support any action, in which case the `Actions` list will be empty. 

**Note:** All entities and actions will have a schema associated with them. For example, an action schema will have the parameter details such as; the parameter names, and its corresponding data type. The schema (metadata) for entities and actions is fetched by the connection at runtime from your backend. If there are any updates to the schema, such updates won't be automatically reflected in your existing connections; you must manually refresh the schema. To refresh the schema for a connection, open the **Connection details** page of the connection, and then click **Refresh connection schema**. 

## Actions

The Dataverse connector provides actions such as ListAssociations and ListNavigationProperties. To understand how to configure the actions, see Action examples.

## Action examples

This section describes how to perform some of the actions in this connector.

### Example - ListAssociations

  1. In the `Configure connector task` dialog, click `Actions`.
  2. Select the `ListAssociations` action, and then click **Done**.
  3. In the **Task Input** section of the **Connectors** task, click `connectorInputPayload` and then enter a value similar to the following in the `Default Value` field: 
         
         {
           FromId:"etywe325632io100",
           FromTable:"Customers",
           "NavigationProperty":"asyncoperations"
           }




## Entity operation examples

### Example - List all the Custom Table Records

This example lists all the Records in the `User defined` Table.

  1. In the `Configure connector task` dialog, click `Entities`.
  2. Select Custome Table Name from the `Entity` list.
  3. Select the `LIST` operation, and then click **Done**.



### Example - Get User based on Id

This example gets the User having newTableId as 568ea947-e03d-ef11-8409-7c1e5217e912 from the `Users` entity.

  1. In the `Configure connector task` dialog, click `Entities`.
  2. Select `Custom Table` from the `Entity` list.
  3. Select the `GET` operation, and then click **Done**.
  4. In the **Task Input** section of the **Connectors** task, click **entityId** and then enter `568ea947-e03d-ef11-8409-7c1e5217e912` in the **Default Value** field. 

Here, `newTableId` is the primary key value of the `Custom Table` entity.

  5. Click **Done**.



## Create connections using Terraform

You can use the [Terraform resource](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/google/latest/docs/resources/integration_connectors_connection) to create a new connection.

To learn how to apply or remove a Terraform configuration, see [Basic Terraform commands](https://docs.cloud.google.com/docs/terraform/basic-commands).

To view a sample terraform template for connection creation, see [sample template](https://docs.cloud.google.com/integration-connectors/docs/sample-terraform-template).

When creating this connection by using Terraform, you must set the following variables in your Terraform configuration file:

Parameter name | Data type | Required | Description  
---|---|---|---  
database | STRING | False | The name of the SAP HANA database.   
browsable_schemas | STRING | False | This property restricts the schemas reported to a subset of the available schemas. For example, BrowsableSchemas=SchemaA,SchemaB,SchemaC.   
include_system_objects | BOOLEAN | False | Set IncludeSystemObjects to True to fetch Hana System schema and tables.   
include_table_types | BOOLEAN | False | If set to true, the provider will report the types of individual tables and views.   
session_variables | STRING | False | A comma-separated list of session variables to set on the current connection.   
enable_logging | ENUM | False | Enables verbosity for logging during a connection by selecting a level between 1 (least verbose) and 5 (most verbose). This feature can aid in troubleshooting error messages or other unexpected behavior. However, please be aware that this option will log all communication details, including requests, responses, and SSL certificates, between the connector and backend. Therefore, it is not advisable to utilize this function in a live production environment. Supported values are: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5  
  
## Use the Dataverse connection in an integration

After you create the connection, it becomes available in both Apigee Integration and Application Integration. You can use the connection in an integration through the Connectors task.

  * To understand how to create and use the Connectors task in Apigee Integration, see [Connectors task](https://docs.cloud.google.com/apigee/docs/api-platform/integration/connectors-task#configure-the-connectors-task).
