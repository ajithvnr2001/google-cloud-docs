This feature is subject to the "Pre-GA Offerings Terms" in the General Service Terms section of the [Service Specific Terms](https://docs.cloud.google.com/terms/service-terms#1). Pre-GA features are available "as is" and might have limited support. For more information, see the [launch stage descriptions](https://cloud.google.com/products/#product-launch-stages). 

# Cloud Spanner

The Cloud Spanner connector lets you perform insert, delete, update, and read operations on Google Cloud Spanner database.

## Before you begin

Before using the Cloud Spanner connector, do the following tasks:

  * In your Google Cloud project: 
    * Ensure that network connectivity is set up. For information about network patterns, see [Network connectivity](https://docs.cloud.google.com/integration-connectors/docs/network-connectivity-private). 
    * Grant the [roles/connectors.admin](https://docs.cloud.google.com/integration-connectors/docs/connectors-access-permissions#iam-roles-for-integration-connectors) IAM role to the user configuring the connector.
    * Grant the following IAM roles to the service account that you want to use for the connector: 
      * `roles/spanner.databaseUser`

A service account is a special type of Google account intended to represent a non-human user that needs to authenticate and be authorized to access data in Google APIs. If you don't have a service account, you must create a service account. The connector and the service account must belong to the same project. For more information, see [Creating a service account](https://docs.cloud.google.com/iam/docs/creating-managing-service-accounts#creating). 

    * Enable the following services: 
      * `secretmanager.googleapis.com` (Secret Manager API)
      * `connectors.googleapis.com` (Connectors API)

To understand how to enable services, see [Enabling services](https://docs.cloud.google.com/service-usage/docs/enable-disable#enabling).

If these services or permissions have not been enabled for your project previously, you are prompted to enable them when configuring the connector. 




## Configure the connector

A connection is specific to a data source. It means that if you have many data sources, you must create a separate connection for each data source. To create a connection, do the following:

  1. In the [Cloud console](https://console.cloud.google.com), go to the **Integration Connectors > Connections** page and then select or create a Google Cloud project. 

[ Go to the Connections page ](https://console.cloud.google.com/connectors/connections)

  2. Click **\+ CREATE NEW** to open the **Create Connection** page.
  3. In the **Location** section, choose the location for the connection. 
     1. **Region** : Select a location from the drop-down list. 

For the list of all the supported regions, see [Locations](https://docs.cloud.google.com/integration-connectors/docs/locations).

     2. Click **NEXT**.
  4. In the **Connection Details** section, complete the following: 
     1. **Connector** : Select **Cloud Spanner** from the drop down list of available Connectors.
     2. **Connector version** : Select the Connector version from the drop down list of available versions. 
     3. In the **Connection Name** field, enter a name for the Connection instance. 

Connection names must meet the following criteria: 

        * Connection names can use letters, numbers, or hyphens.
        * Letters must be lower-case.
        * Connection names must begin with a letter and end with a letter or number.
        * Connection names cannot exceed 49 characters.
     4. Optionally, enter a **Description** for the connection instance.
     5. Optionally, enable [Cloud logging](https://docs.cloud.google.com/integration-connectors/docs/view-connector-logs), and then select a log level. By default, the log level is set to `Error`. 
     6. **Service Account** : Select a service account that has the required roles.
     7. Optionally, configure the **Connection node settings** : 

        * **Minimum number of nodes** : Enter the minimum number of connection nodes.
        * **Maximum number of nodes** : Enter the maximum number of connection nodes.

A node is a unit (or replica) of a connection that processes transactions. More nodes are required to process more transactions for a connection and conversely, fewer nodes are required to process fewer transactions. To understand how the nodes affect your connector pricing, see [ Pricing for connection nodes](https://docs.cloud.google.com/integration-connectors/docs/pricing#pricing-for-connection-nodes). If you don't enter any values, by default the minimum nodes are set to 2 (for better availability) and the maximum nodes are set to 50.

**Note:** You can customize the connection node values only if you are a Pay-as-you-go customer.
     8. **Project ID** : The ID of the Google Cloud project where the Spanner instance resides. 
     9. **Database Region** : The name of the region where the Spanner instance resides. 
     10. **Instance ID** : The ID of the Spanner instance to connect to. 
     11. **Database Name** : The name of the Spanner database to connect to. 
     12. Optionally, click **\+ ADD LABEL** to add a label to the Connection in the form of a key/value pair.
     13. Click **NEXT**.
  5. In the **Authentication** section, enter the authentication details. 
     1. The Cloud Spanner connection doesn't require any authentication.
     2. Click **NEXT**.
  6. **Review** : Review your connection and authentication details.
  7. Click **Create**.



## Entities, operations, and actions

All the Integration Connectors provide a layer of abstraction for the objects of the connected application. You can access an application's objects only through this abstraction. The abstraction is exposed to you as entities, operations, and actions.

**Note:** You can view the entities, operations, and actions of a connector in the [Connectors task](https://docs.cloud.google.com/application-integration/docs/connectors-task).

  * **Entity:** An entity can be thought of as an object, or a collection of properties, in the connected application or service. The definition of an entity differs from a connector to a connector. For example, in a database connector, tables are the entities, in a file server connector, folders are the entities, and in a messaging system connector, queues are the entities. 

However, it is possible that a connector doesn't support or have any entities, in which case the `Entities` list will be empty.

  * **Operation:** An operation is the activity that you can perform on an entity. You can perform any of the following operations on an entity: 
    * [List](https://docs.cloud.google.com/application-integration/docs/configure-connectors-task#config-prop)
    * [Get](https://docs.cloud.google.com/application-integration/docs/configure-connectors-task#config-prop)
    * [Create](https://docs.cloud.google.com/application-integration/docs/configure-connectors-task#config-prop)
    * [Update](https://docs.cloud.google.com/application-integration/docs/configure-connectors-task#config-prop)
    * [Delete](https://docs.cloud.google.com/application-integration/docs/configure-connectors-task#config-prop)

Selecting an entity from the available list, generates a list of operations available for the entity. For a detailed description of the operations, see the Connectors task's [entity operations](https://docs.cloud.google.com/application-integration/docs/connectors-task#config-prop). However, if a connector doesn't support any of the entity operations, such unsupported operations aren't listed in the `Operations` list.

  * **Action:** An action is a first class function that is made available to the integration through the connector interface. An action lets you make changes to an entity or entities, and vary from connector to connector. Normally, an action will have some input parameters, and an output parameter. However, it is possible that a connector doesn't support any action, in which case the `Actions` list will be empty. 

**Note:** All entities and actions will have a schema associated with them. For example, an action schema will have the parameter details such as; the parameter names, and its corresponding data type. The schema (metadata) for entities and actions is fetched by the connection at runtime from your backend. If there are any updates to the schema, such updates won't be automatically reflected in your existing connections; you must manually refresh the schema. To refresh the schema for a connection, open the **Connection details** page of the connection, and then click **Refresh connection schema**. 

## Actions

This connector supports execution of the following actions: 

  * **User-defined stored procedures and functions.** If you have any stored procedures and functions in your backend, those are listed in the `Actions` column of the `Configure connector task` dialog.
  * **Custom SQL queries.** To execute custom SQL queries, the connector provides the **Execute custom query** action. 

To create a custom query, follow these steps: 

    1. Follow the detailed instructions to [ add a connectors task](https://docs.cloud.google.com/application-integration/docs/configure-connectors-task#add-a-connectors-task).
    2. When you [configure the connector task](https://docs.cloud.google.com/application-integration/docs/configure-connectors-task#configure-the-connectors-task), in the type of action you want to perform, select **Actions**.
    3. In the **Action** list, select **Execute custom query** , and then click **Done**.

    4. Expand the **Task input** section, and then do the following: 
       1. In the **Timeout after** field, enter the number of seconds to wait till the query executes. 

Default value: `180` seconds.

       2. In the **Maximum number of rows** field, enter the maximum number of rows to be returned from the database.

Default value: `25`.

       3. To update the custom query, click **Edit Custom Script**. The **Script editor** dialog opens. 

![image showing custom-sql-query](https://docs.cloud.google.com/static/application-integration/images/add-custom-sql-query.png)![image showing custom-sql-query](https://docs.cloud.google.com/static/application-integration/images/add-custom-sql-query.png)

       4. In the **Script editor** dialog, enter the SQL query and click **Save**. 

You can use a question mark (?) in a SQL statement to represent a single parameter that must be specified in the query parameters list. For example, the following SQL query selects all rows from the `Employees` table that matches the values specified for the `LastName` column: 
              
              SELECT * FROM Employees where LastName=?

**Note:** Data manipulation language (DML) and data definition language (DDL) statements are supported.
       5. If you've used question marks in your SQL query, you must add the parameter by clicking **\+ Add Parameter Name** for each question mark. While executing the integration, these parameters replace the question marks (?) in the SQL query sequentially. For example, if you have added three question marks (?), then you must add three parameters in order of sequence. 

![image showing add-query-param](https://docs.cloud.google.com/static/application-integration/images/add-query-param.png)![image showing add-query-param](https://docs.cloud.google.com/static/application-integration/images/add-query-param.png)

To add query parameters, do the following:

          1. From the **Type** list, select the data type of the parameter.
          2. In the **Value** field, enter the value of the parameter.
          3. To add multiple parameters, click **\+ Add Query Parameter**.

The **Execute custom query** action does not support array variables.
