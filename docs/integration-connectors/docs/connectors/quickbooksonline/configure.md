# QuickBooks Online

The QuickBooks Online connector lets you perform insert, delete, update, and read operations on QuickBooks database.

## Before you begin

Before using the QuickBooks Online connector, do the following tasks:

  * In your Google Cloud project: 
    * Ensure that network connectivity is set up. For information about network patterns, see [Network connectivity](https://docs.cloud.google.com/integration-connectors/docs/network-connectivity-private). 
    * Grant the [roles/connectors.admin](https://docs.cloud.google.com/integration-connectors/docs/connectors-access-permissions#iam-roles-for-integration-connectors) IAM role to the user configuring the connector.
    * Grant the following IAM roles to the service account that you want to use for the connector: 
      * `roles/secretmanager.viewer`
      * `roles/secretmanager.secretAccessor`

A service account is a special type of Google account intended to represent a non-human user that needs to authenticate and be authorized to access data in Google APIs. If you don't have a service account, you must create a service account. The connector and the service account must belong to the same project. For more information, see [Creating a service account](https://docs.cloud.google.com/iam/docs/creating-managing-service-accounts#creating). 

    * Enable the following services: 
      * `secretmanager.googleapis.com` (Secret Manager API)
      * `connectors.googleapis.com` (Connectors API)

To understand how to enable services, see [Enabling services](https://docs.cloud.google.com/service-usage/docs/enable-disable#enabling).

If these services or permissions have not been enabled for your project previously, you are prompted to enable them when configuring the connector. 




## Configure the connector

A connection is specific to a data source. It means that if you have many data sources, you must create a separate connection for each data source. To create a connection, do the following:

  1. In the [Cloud console](https://console.cloud.google.com), go to the **Integration Connectors > Connections** page and then select or create a Google Cloud project. 

[ Go to the Connections page ](https://console.cloud.google.com/connectors/connections)

  2. Click **\+ CREATE NEW** to open the **Create Connection** page.
  3. In the **Location** section, choose the location for the connection. 
     1. **Region** : Select a location from the drop-down list. 

For the list of all the supported regions, see [Locations](https://docs.cloud.google.com/integration-connectors/docs/locations).

     2. Click **NEXT**.
  4. In the **Connection Details** section, complete the following: 
     1. **Connector** : Select **QuickBooks** from the drop down list of available Connectors.
     2. **Connector version** : Select the Connector version from the drop down list of available versions. 
     3. In the **Connection Name** field, enter a name for the Connection instance. 

Connection names must meet the following criteria: 

        * Connection names can use letters, numbers, or hyphens.
        * Letters must be lower-case.
        * Connection names must begin with a letter and end with a letter or number.
        * Connection names cannot exceed 49 characters.
     4. Optionally, enter a **Description** for the connection instance.
     5. **Service Account** : Select a service account that has the required roles.
     6. Optionally, configure the **Connection node settings** : 

        * **Minimum number of nodes** : Enter the minimum number of connection nodes.
        * **Maximum number of nodes** : Enter the maximum number of connection nodes.

A node is a unit (or replica) of a connection that processes transactions. More nodes are required to process more transactions for a connection and conversely, fewer nodes are required to process fewer transactions. To understand how the nodes affect your connector pricing, see [ Pricing for connection nodes](https://docs.cloud.google.com/integration-connectors/docs/pricing#pricing-for-connection-nodes). If you don't enter any values, by default the minimum nodes are set to 2 (for better availability) and the maximum nodes are set to 50.

**Note:** You can customize the connection node values only if you are a Pay-as-you-go customer.
     7. **Company Id** : Provide the company id of the App registered in intuit developer portal. 
     8. Optionally, enter a **Country Code** : for the edition of QuickBooks Online being used. 
     9. Optionally, enter a **Minor Version** : to be used when sending requests to the QuickBooks Online API. 
     10. **Use Sandbox** : Click on the checkbox if you are using a Sandbox account. 
     11. (Optional) In the **Advanced settings** section, select the **Use proxy** checkbox to configure a proxy server for the connection and configure the following values: 
        * **Proxy Auth Scheme** : Select the authentication type to authenticate with the proxy server. The following authentication types are supported: 
          * **Basic** : Basic HTTP authentication.
          * **Digest** : Digest HTTP authentication.
        * **Proxy User** : A user name to be used to authenticate with the proxy server. 
        * **Proxy Password** : The Secret manager secret of the user's password. 
        * **Proxy SSL Type** : The SSL type to use when connecting to the proxy server. The following authentication types are supported: 
          * **Auto** : Default setting. If the URL is an HTTPS URL, then the Tunnel option is used. If the URL is an HTTP URL, then the NEVER option is used.
          * **Always** : The connection is always SSL enabled.
          * **Never** : The connection is not SSL enabled.
          * **Tunnel** : The connection is through a tunneling proxy. The proxy server opens a connection to the remote host and traffic flows back and forth through the proxy.
        * In the **Proxy Server** section, enter details of the proxy server. 
          1. Click **\+ Add destination**.
          2. Select a **Destination Type**. 
             * **Host address** : Specify the hostname or IP address of the destination. 

If you want to establish a private connection to your backend system, do the following:

               * Create a [PSC service attachment](https://docs.cloud.google.com/integration-connectors/docs/configure-psc).
               * Create an [endpoint attachment](https://docs.cloud.google.com/integration-connectors/docs/create-ep-attachment) and then enter the details of the endpoint attachment in the **Host address** field.
     12. Optionally, click **\+ ADD LABEL** to add a label to the Connection in the form of a key/value pair.
     13. Click **NEXT**.
  5. In the **Destinations** section, enter details of the remote host (backend system) you want to connect to. 
     1. **Destination Type** : Select a **Destination Type**. 
        * To specify the destination hostname or IP address, select **Host address** and enter the address in the **host 1** field.
        * To establish a private connection, select **Endpoint attachment**. In the **Endpoint Attachment** list, select the endpoint attachment created for your backend system.
**Note:** To learn how to create an endpoint attachment, see [Private network connectivity](https://docs.cloud.google.com/integration-connectors/docs/network-connectivity-private). After creating the endpoint attachment, it is visible in the **Endpoint Attachment** list.

If you want to establish a public connection to your backend systems with additional security, you can consider [configuring static outbound IP addresses for your connections](https://docs.cloud.google.com/integration-connectors/docs/configure-static-ip), and then configure your firewall rules to allowlist only the specific static IP addresses. 

To enter additional destinations, click **+ADD DESTINATION**.

  6. Click **NEXT**.

    * **Username** : Username for connector
    * **Password** : Secret Manager Secret containing the password associated with the connector.



## Entities, operations, and actions

All the Integration Connectors provide a layer of abstraction for the objects of the connected application. You can access an application's objects only through this abstraction. The abstraction is exposed to you as entities, operations, and actions.

**Note:** You can view the entities, operations, and actions of a connector in the [Connectors task](https://docs.cloud.google.com/application-integration/docs/connectors-task).

  * **Entity:** An entity can be thought of as an object, or a collection of properties, in the connected application or service. The definition of an entity differs from a connector to a connector. For example, in a database connector, tables are the entities, in a file server connector, folders are the entities, and in a messaging system connector, queues are the entities. 

However, it is possible that a connector doesn't support or have any entities, in which case the `Entities` list will be empty.

  * **Operation:** An operation is the activity that you can perform on an entity. You can perform any of the following operations on an entity: 
    * [List](https://docs.cloud.google.com/application-integration/docs/configure-connectors-task#config-prop)
    * [Get](https://docs.cloud.google.com/application-integration/docs/configure-connectors-task#config-prop)
    * [Create](https://docs.cloud.google.com/application-integration/docs/configure-connectors-task#config-prop)
    * [Update](https://docs.cloud.google.com/application-integration/docs/configure-connectors-task#config-prop)
    * [Delete](https://docs.cloud.google.com/application-integration/docs/configure-connectors-task#config-prop)

Selecting an entity from the available list, generates a list of operations available for the entity. For a detailed description of the operations, see the Connectors task's [entity operations](https://docs.cloud.google.com/application-integration/docs/connectors-task#config-prop). However, if a connector doesn't support any of the entity operations, such unsupported operations aren't listed in the `Operations` list.

  * **Action:** An action is a first class function that is made available to the integration through the connector interface. An action lets you make changes to an entity or entities, and vary from connector to connector. Normally, an action will have some input parameters, and an output parameter. However, it is possible that a connector doesn't support any action, in which case the `Actions` list will be empty. 

**Note:** All entities and actions will have a schema associated with them. For example, an action schema will have the parameter details such as; the parameter names, and its corresponding data type. The schema (metadata) for entities and actions is fetched by the connection at runtime from your backend. If there are any updates to the schema, such updates won't be automatically reflected in your existing connections; you must manually refresh the schema. To refresh the schema for a connection, open the **Connection details** page of the connection, and then click **Refresh connection schema**. 

## System limitations

The QuickBooks Online connector can process 1 transaction per second, per [node](https://docs.cloud.google.com/integration-connectors/docs/pricing#payg), and [throttles](https://docs.cloud.google.com/integration-connectors/docs/rate-limiting) any transactions beyond this limit. By default, Integration Connectors allocates 2 nodes (for better availability) for a connection. 

For information on the limits applicable to Integration Connectors, see [Limits](https://docs.cloud.google.com/integration-connectors/docs/quotas).

**Note:** The number of [Integration Connectors nodes](https://docs.cloud.google.com/integration-connectors/docs/pricing#pricing-for-connection-nodes) will autoscale dynamically based on your usage. However, if you want to reserve capacity for large volumes without waiting for autoscaling, you can adjust the minimum node value for a connection. More nodes are required to process more transactions for a connection. Conversely, fewer nodes are required if a connection processes fewer transactions. To configure the node values, do the following: 

  * If you are a pay-as-you-go customer, configure the minimum and maximum node value in the edit connection page. 
  * If you are a subscription based customer, [contact support](https://docs.cloud.google.com/integration-connectors/docs/getting-support).



The maximum transactions that a node can handle depends on various factors. So, before adjusting the minimum nodes for better throughput, it is recommended you check if your backend systems are set up optimally to handle the required traffic.

## Entity operation examples
