Revokes all sessions for the specified `WorkforcePoolSubject`. Revoking sessions invalidates all active sessions and previously issued credentials for the subject, requiring the user to re-authenticate with the identity provider.

### HTTP request

`POST https://iam.googleapis.com/v1/{name=locations/*/workforcePools/*/subjects/*}:revokeSessions`

The URL uses [gRPC Transcoding](https://google.aip.dev/127) syntax.

### Path parameters

Parameters  
---  
`name` |  `string` Required. The resource name of the `WorkforcePoolSubject`. Special characters, such as `/` and `:`, must be escaped, because all URLs must conform to the "When to Escape and Unescape" section of [RFC 3986](https://www.rfc-editor.org/info/rfc3986/).Format: `locations/{location}/workforcePools/{workforcePoolId}/subjects/{subject_id}`  
  
### Request body

The request body must be empty.

### Response body

If successful, the response body contains an instance of `[Operation](https://docs.cloud.google.com/iam/docs/reference/rest/Shared.Types/Operation)`.

### Authorization scopes

Requires one of the following OAuth scopes:

  * `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/cloud-platform`
  * ` https://www.googleapis.com/auth/iam`
