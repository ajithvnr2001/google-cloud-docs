### HTTP request

`PATCH https://iam.googleapis.com/v1/{name=organizations/*/roles/*}`

The URL uses [gRPC Transcoding](https://google.aip.dev/127) syntax.

### Path parameters

Parameters  
---  
`name` |  `string` The `name` parameter's value depends on the target resource for the request, namely [projects](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/reference/rest/v1/projects.roles) or [organizations](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/reference/rest/v1/organizations.roles). Each resource type's `name` value format is described below:

  * [projects.roles.patch](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/reference/rest/v1/projects.roles/patch): `projects/{PROJECT_ID}/roles/{CUSTOM_ROLE_ID}`. This method updates only [custom roles](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/understanding-custom-roles) that have been created at the project level. Example request URL: `https://iam.googleapis.com/v1/projects/{PROJECT_ID}/roles/{CUSTOM_ROLE_ID}`
  * [organizations.roles.patch](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/reference/rest/v1/organizations.roles/patch): `organizations/{ORGANIZATION_ID}/roles/{CUSTOM_ROLE_ID}`.

Example request URL: `https://iam.googleapis.com/v1/organizations/{ORGANIZATION_ID}/roles/{CUSTOM_ROLE_ID}`
