Demonstrates retrieving a service account key.

## Code sample

### C++

To learn how to install and use the client library for IAM, see [IAM client libraries](https://docs.cloud.google.com/iam/docs/reference/libraries). For more information, see the [IAM C++ API reference documentation](https://docs.cloud.google.com/cpp/docs/reference/iam/latest). 

To authenticate to IAM, set up Application Default Credentials. For more information, see [Set up authentication for a local development environment](https://docs.cloud.google.com/docs/authentication/set-up-adc-local-dev-environment). 
    
    
    namespace iam = ::google::cloud::iam_admin_v1;
    [](std::string const& key_name) {
      iam::IAMClient client(iam::MakeIAMConnection());
      auto response = client.GetServiceAccountKey(
          key_name, google::iam::admin::v1::ServiceAccountPublicKeyType::
                        TYPE_X509_PEM_FILE);
      if (!response) throw std::move(response).status();
      std::cout << "ServiceAccountKey successfully retrieved: "
                << response->DebugString() << "\n";
    }
