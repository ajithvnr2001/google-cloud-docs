# Scan Java packages automatically

Learn how to enable automatic scanning, push a container image on Artifact Registry, and see a list of any vulnerabilities found in the image.

Artifact Analysis scans for vulnerabilities each time an image is pushed to Artifact Registry. Platform administrators and application developers can use this automatic scanning feature to help identify risks in their software delivery pipeline.

This quickstart uses a simple publicly available package to demonstrate one type of package scanning. By default, Artifact Analysis scans for vulnerabilities in multiple package types once you enable the scanning API. Supported package types include: OS, Go, Java (Maven), Python and Node.js (npm).

## Before you begin

  1. Sign in to your Google Cloud account. If you're new to Google Cloud, [ create an account](https://console.cloud.google.com/freetrial) to evaluate how our products perform in real-world scenarios. New customers also get $300 in free credits to run, test, and deploy workloads. 
  2. [Install](https://docs.cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/install) the Google Cloud CLI. 

  3. If you're using an external identity provider (IdP), you must first [ sign in to the gcloud CLI with your federated identity](https://docs.cloud.google.com/iam/docs/workforce-log-in-gcloud). 

  4. To [initialize](https://docs.cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/initializing) the gcloud CLI, run the following command: 
         
         gcloud init

  5. [Create or select a Google Cloud project](https://cloud.google.com/resource-manager/docs/creating-managing-projects).

**Roles required to select or create a project**

     * **Select a project** : Selecting a project doesn't require a specific IAM role—you can select any project that you've been granted a role on. 
     * **Create a project** : To create a project, you need the Project Creator role (`roles/resourcemanager.projectCreator`), which contains the `resourcemanager.projects.create` permission. [Learn how to grant roles](https://docs.cloud.google.com/iam/docs/granting-changing-revoking-access). 
**Note** : If you don't plan to keep the resources that you create in this procedure, create a project instead of selecting an existing project. After you finish these steps, you can delete the project, removing all resources associated with the project.
     * Create a Google Cloud project:
           
           gcloud projects create PROJECT_ID

Replace `PROJECT_ID` with a name for the Google Cloud project you are creating.

     * Select the Google Cloud project that you created:
           
           gcloud config set project PROJECT_ID

Replace `PROJECT_ID` with your Google Cloud project name.

  6. [Verify that billing is enabled for your Google Cloud project](https://docs.cloud.google.com/billing/docs/how-to/verify-billing-enabled#confirm_billing_is_enabled_on_a_project). 

  7. Enable the Artifact Registry and Container Scanning APIs, if any are not already enabled: 

**Roles required to enable APIs**

To enable APIs, you need the `serviceusage.services.enable` permission. If you created the project, then you likely already have this permission through the Owner role (`roles/owner`). Otherwise, you can get this permission through the Service Usage Admin role (`roles/serviceusage.serviceUsageAdmin`). [Learn how to grant roles](https://docs.cloud.google.com/iam/docs/granting-changing-revoking-access). 
         
         gcloud services enable containerscanning.googleapis.com  artifactregistry.googleapis.com

  8. [Install](https://docs.cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/install) the Google Cloud CLI. 

  9. If you're using an external identity provider (IdP), you must first [ sign in to the gcloud CLI with your federated identity](https://docs.cloud.google.com/iam/docs/workforce-log-in-gcloud). 

  10. To [initialize](https://docs.cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/initializing) the gcloud CLI, run the following command: 
         
         gcloud init

  11. [Create or select a Google Cloud project](https://cloud.google.com/resource-manager/docs/creating-managing-projects).

**Roles required to select or create a project**

     * **Select a project** : Selecting a project doesn't require a specific IAM role—you can select any project that you've been granted a role on. 
     * **Create a project** : To create a project, you need the Project Creator role (`roles/resourcemanager.projectCreator`), which contains the `resourcemanager.projects.create` permission. [Learn how to grant roles](https://docs.cloud.google.com/iam/docs/granting-changing-revoking-access). 
**Note** : If you don't plan to keep the resources that you create in this procedure, create a project instead of selecting an existing project. After you finish these steps, you can delete the project, removing all resources associated with the project.
     * Create a Google Cloud project:
           
           gcloud projects create PROJECT_ID

Replace `PROJECT_ID` with a name for the Google Cloud project you are creating.

     * Select the Google Cloud project that you created:
           
           gcloud config set project PROJECT_ID

Replace `PROJECT_ID` with your Google Cloud project name.

  12. [Verify that billing is enabled for your Google Cloud project](https://docs.cloud.google.com/billing/docs/how-to/verify-billing-enabled#confirm_billing_is_enabled_on_a_project). 

  13. Enable the Artifact Registry and Container Scanning APIs, if any are not already enabled: 

**Roles required to enable APIs**

To enable APIs, you need the `serviceusage.services.enable` permission. If you created the project, then you likely already have this permission through the Owner role (`roles/owner`). Otherwise, you can get this permission through the Service Usage Admin role (`roles/serviceusage.serviceUsageAdmin`). [Learn how to grant roles](https://docs.cloud.google.com/iam/docs/granting-changing-revoking-access). 
         
         gcloud services enable containerscanning.googleapis.com  artifactregistry.googleapis.com


**Important:** When you enable the Artifact Analysis API, Artifact Analysis automatically begins scanning each new image as they are pushed to Artifact Registry repositories in your project. However, scanning is disabled by default for packages pushed to Artifact Registry repositories. To enable scanning in a repository, see [Control scanning settings for an individual repository](https://docs.cloud.google.com/artifact-analysis/docs/enable-automatic-scanning#disable-repo).

## Create a Docker repository in Artifact Registry

Create a Docker repository to store the sample image for this quickstart.

  1. Open the **Repositories** page in the Google Cloud console.

[Open the Repositories page](https://console.cloud.google.com/artifacts)

  2. Click **Create Repository**.

  3. On the **Create Repository** page, input the following settings:

     * **Name** : `quickstart-docker-repo`
     * **Format** : Docker
     * **Mode** : Standard
     * **Location type** : Region
     * **Region** : `us-central1`
  4. Click **Create**.




You see the **Repositories** page. Your `quickstart-docker-repo` repository is added to the repository list.

## Configure authentication

Before you can push or pull images with Artifact Registry, you must configure Docker to use the Google Cloud CLI to authenticate requests to Artifact Registry. 

In the Cloud Shell or your local shell, set up authentication for Docker repositories in the region `us-central1`:
    
    
    gcloud auth configure-docker us-central1-docker.pkg.dev
    

## Obtain a package

  1. Change to a directory where you want to save your container image.

  2. Copy an image into your local directory. For example, you can use Docker to pull the latest Jenkins image from [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/_/jenkins).
         
         docker pull jenkins:2.60.3-alpine
         




## Tag your package with a repository name

When you want to push a package to Artifact Registry, you need to configure the `docker push` command to push the image to a specific location.

Run the following command to tag the image as `quickstart-image:tag1`:
    
    
    docker tag jenkins:2.60.3-alpine \
    us-central1-docker.pkg.dev/PROJECT/quickstart-docker-repo/quickstart-image:tag1

Where

  * PROJECT is your Google Cloud [project ID](https://docs.cloud.google.com/resource-manager/docs/creating-managing-projects#identifying_projects). If your project ID contains a colon (`:`), see [Domain-scoped projects](https://docs.cloud.google.com/artifact-registry/docs/docker/names#domain).
  * `us-central1` is the Artifact Registry repository region.
  * `docker.pkg.dev` is the hostname for Docker repositories.
  * `quickstart-image` is the image name you want to use in the repository. The image name can be different than the local image name.
  * `tag1` is a tag you're adding to the Docker image. If you didn't specify a tag, Docker will apply the default tag `latest`.



## Push the image to Artifact Registry

Artifact Analysis automatically scans new images when they're uploaded to Artifact Registry.

To push the image to your Docker repository in Artifact Registry, run the following command:
    
    
    docker push us-central1-docker.pkg.dev/PROJECT/quickstart-docker-repo/quickstart-image:tag1

Replace PROJECT with your Google Cloud [project ID](https://docs.cloud.google.com/resource-manager/docs/creating-managing-projects#identifying_projects). If your project ID contains a colon (`:`), see [Domain-scoped projects](https://docs.cloud.google.com/artifact-registry/docs/docker/names#domain).

## Clean up

To avoid incurring charges to your Google Cloud account for the resources used on this page, delete the Google Cloud project with the resources. 

If you created a new project for this guide, you can now delete the project. 

**Caution** : Deleting a project has the following effects: 
     * **Everything in the project is deleted.** If you used an existing project for the tasks in this document, when you delete it, you also delete any other work you've done in the project. 
     * **Custom project IDs are lost.** When you created this project, you might have created a custom project ID that you want to use in the future. To preserve the URLs that use the project ID, such as an `appspot.com` URL, delete selected resources inside the project instead of deleting the whole project. 

If you plan to explore multiple architectures, tutorials, or quickstarts, reusing projects can help you avoid exceeding project quota limits. 

  1. In the Google Cloud console, go to the **Manage resources** page. 

[Go to Manage resources](https://console.cloud.google.com/iam-admin/projects)

  2. In the project list, select the project that you want to delete, and then click **Delete**. 
  3. In the dialog, type the project ID, and then click **Shut down** to delete the project.
