DESCRIPTION
     Updates the parameters of a single Managed Lustre instance. 
EXAMPLES
     To update the description of an instance `my-instance` in location `us-central1-a` run: 
    
    
    gcloud lustre instances update my-instance --location=us-central1-a --description="<updated description>"

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
    

Instance resource - Identifier. The name of the instance. This represents a Cloud resource. (NOTE) Some attributes are not given arguments in this group but can be set in other ways. 

To set the `project` attribute: 

  * provide the argument `instance` on the command line with a fully specified name; 
  * provide the argument `--project` on the command line; 
  * set the property `core/project`. 



To set the `location` attribute: 

  * provide the argument `instance` on the command line with a fully specified name; 
  * provide the argument `--location` on the command line. 



This must be specified. 

`INSTANCE`
     ID of the instance or fully qualified identifier for the instance. 

To set the `instance` attribute: 

  * provide the argument `instance` on the command line. 


FLAGS
    

`--async`
     Return immediately, without waiting for the operation in progress to complete. 
`--capacity-gib`=`CAPACITY_GIB`
     The storage capacity of the instance in gibibytes (GiB). Allowed values depend on the `per_unit_storage_throughput`. See [Performance tiers](https://docs.cloud.google.com/managed-lustre/docs/performance-tiers) for specific minimums, maximums, and step sizes for each performance tier. 
`--description`=`DESCRIPTION`
     A user-readable description of the instance. 
`--[no-]gke-support-enabled`
     Deprecated: No longer required for GKE instance creation. Indicates whether you want to enable support for GKE clients. By default, GKE clients are not supported. Use `--gke-support-enabled` to enable and `--no-gke-support-enabled` to disable. 
`--location`=`LOCATION`
     For resources [instance, placement-policy], provides fallback value for resource location attribute. When the resource's full URI path is not provided, location will fallback to this flag value. 
`--per-unit-storage-throughput`=`PER_UNIT_STORAGE_THROUGHPUT`
     The throughput of the instance in MBps per TiB. Valid values are 0, 125, 250, 500, 1000. See [Performance tiers](https://docs.cloud.google.com/managed-lustre/docs/performance-tiers) for more information. 

If the instance is using the Dynamic tier, this field must not be set or must be set to zero. 

`--request-id`=`REQUEST_ID`
     An optional request ID to identify requests. Specify a unique request ID so that if you must retry your request, the server will know to ignore the request if it has already been completed. The server will guarantee that for at least 60 minutes since the first request. 

For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and the request times out. If you make the request again with the same request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments. 

The request ID must be a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID is not supported (00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000). 

Arguments for the target version. 
`--target-version`=`TARGET_VERSION`
     The target version for the instance. To trigger an upgrade, specify a version listed in `available_version`, or `latest` for the newest version. 
IP-based access rules for the Managed Lustre instance. These options define the root user squash configuration. 
`--clear-`
     Set instance.accessRulesOptions back to default value. 
`--default-squash-gid`=`DEFAULT_SQUASH_GID`
     The user squash GID for the default access rule. This user squash GID applies to all root users connecting from clients that are not matched by any of the access rules. If not set, the default is 0 (no GID squash). 
`--default-squash-mode`=`DEFAULT_SQUASH_MODE`
     The squash mode for the default access rule. `DEFAULT_SQUASH_MODE` must be one of: 

`no-squash`
     Squash is disabled. 

If set inside an `AccessRule`, root users matching the `ip_address_ranges` are not squashed. 

If set as the `default_squash_mode`, root squash is disabled for this instance. 

If the default squash mode is `NO_SQUASH`, do not set the `default_squash_uid` or `default_squash_gid`, or an `invalid argument` error is returned. 

`root-squash`
     Root user squash is enabled. 

Not supported inside an `AccessRule`. 

If set as the `default_squash_mode`, root users not matching any of the `access_rules` are squashed to the `default_squash_uid` and `default_squash_gid`. 

`--default-squash-uid`=`DEFAULT_SQUASH_UID`
     The user squash UID for the default access rule. This user squash UID applies to all root users connecting from clients that are not matched by any of the access rules. If not set, the default is 0 (no UID squash).
