## Backup and DR Service pricing

This document discusses Backup and DR pricing details.

### Overview

Backup and DR Service offers a consumption-based billing model, which is based on the following components:

  * [Backup storage charge.](https://docs.cloud.google.com/backup-disaster-recovery/pricing#backup-storage-charge) These charges are agnostic to the type of resource being protected.
  * [Backup management charge.](https://docs.cloud.google.com/backup-disaster-recovery/pricing#backup-management-charge) These charges are specific to the type of resource being protected.
  * [Inter-region data transfer charge.](https://docs.cloud.google.com/backup-disaster-recovery/pricing#inter-region-data-transfer-charge) These charges are agnostic to the type of resource being protected.
  * [Multi-regional upload and download charges.](https://docs.cloud.google.com/backup-disaster-recovery/pricing#multi-regional-upload-download-charges) These charges are agnostic to the type of resource being protected.



**Note:** Backup and DR Service users were not charged for the following SKUs before December 2, 2024 while the [backup vault](https://docs.cloud.google.com/backup-disaster-recovery/docs/concepts/backup-vault) feature was in Preview. Starting on December 2, 2024 Backup and DR Service users are responsible for these charges.

\- All storage SKUs for data stored in a backup vault (for example, Prefix = "BackupDR: Storage")

\- All management SKUs for resources protected into a backup vault (for example, Prefix = "BackupDR: Management")

\- All inter-region data transfer SKUs (for example, Prefix = "BackupDR: Networking")

## 

Backup storage charge

The SKUs used to bill Backup and DR Service storage charges depend on whether the protected resource is being protected into a [backup vault](https://cloud.google.com/backup-disaster-recovery/docs/concepts/backup-vault) or to [self-managed storage](https://cloud.google.com/backup-disaster-recovery/docs/concepts/backup-dr#self-managed_storage).

If a resource is protected into a backup vault, storage charges will be billed to the project where the backup vault was created, using the Backup and DR Service SKUs and with pricing defined in the table below.

## 

Resources not under active protection, but with backups in a backup vault

If a resource is no longer under active protection (i.e. resource protection is “inactive”) into a given backup vault, but still has backup data in that backup vault, management charges will be billed to the project where the backup vault was created and using the SKU and price point listed below.

HourlyHourly

MonthlyMonthly

Item| Pricing model| Meter| Price (USD)  
---|---|---|---  
BackupDR: Management - In GCP - Long-Term Retention| Usage-based| Per GiB per unit time of stored data| $0.000013699  
  
Also note the following scenarios in which resource protection will be considered “inactive”:

  * See [billing behavior associated with API disablement](https://docs.cloud.google.com/backup-disaster-recovery/pricing#what-happens-if-the-backup-and-dr-service-api-is-disabled)
  * For resources protected via a backup/recovery appliance:
  * If the backup/recovery appliance does not communicate with the backup vault for 24 hours, the associated backup vault resource protection will be considered “inactive”



## 

How is Backup and DR management usage measured?

To calculate management charges, Backup and DR measures usage based on the actual workload size at the frontend or the size of the workload it is managing. The unit of measurement is [gibibyte (GiB)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gibibyte). One gibibyte = 1024 * 1024 * 1024 bytes.

If the workload under management reports the volume size for data, Backup and DR takes into account the volume size reported (for example, the usage calculation for VMware will be consistent with the reported size of the VM in vCenter).

If you manage 10 TiB of Oracle data spread across multiple databases, the Backup and DR usage reports 10 * 1024 GiB of data usage.

**Note:** Backup and DR usage measurement does not take into account the frequency of data capture, where the copies are stored, how many copies are made, the data change rate, the retention period, or how much storage is occupied by copies.

**Usage measurement for Compute Engine, when backing up to self-managed storage**

When backing up to self-managed storage, Backup and DR measures usage for Compute Engine VM backups based on the amount of PD storage attached to a Compute Engine VM at the time of backup. Backup and DR allows you to exclude PD volumes from backup. In such instances, only volumes identified to be backed up are used to measure the usage.

For example, if two PD volumes of one TiB and two TiB are attached to a Compute Engine VM and you configure the backup SLT to exclude the 2TiB volume, the usage for the VM is measured to be one TiB.

Additionally, if the 1TiB VM grows or shrinks, Backup and DR measures usage based on the size of the volume at the time of the latest backup.

**Usage measurement for Compute Engine, when backing up to a backup vault**

When backing up to a backup vault, Backup and DR measures usage for Compute Engine VM as described below

  * Management charges are based on the size of the Compute Engine VM at the time of backup. For example, if a VM has a total of 1 TiB storage attached, the management charges will be for the 1 TiB regardless of the storage used.
  * Additionally, if the 1TiB VM grows or shrinks, Backup and DR measures usage based on the size of the VM at the time of the latest backup.



**Usage measurement when backing up independent disks (Persistent and Hyperdisks) to a backup vault**

For backups stored in a backup vault, Backup and DR calculates usage for independent Persistent/Hyper disks as follows:

  * Management fees are determined by the Persistent/Hyper disk size at the time of each backup. This means a 1 TiB disk will incur management charges for 1 TiB, regardless of actual storage used.
  * Furthermore, Backup and DR will recalculate usage based on the disk's current size during the most recent backup, even if the VM disk size has changed since the previous backup.



**Usage measurement for agentless VMware Engine**

 _For VMware Engine ve1 and ve2 nodes_

The pricing is calculated based on the number and type of ESXi nodes that are being protected. A ESXi node is considered to be protected if one or more of VMs attached to it are being protected by Backup and DR Service.

Below is an example that demonstrates the billing process for VMware Engine:

  * Price to backup a single VMware Engine ve1 node (VM backups only) in us-central1 region for a month = (List price to backup the node/ hour) X (No. of hours in a day node is active) X (No. of days in a month).
  * Considering the VMware Engine node is active for 24 hours, there are 30 days in a month, and the price to backup a node will be $0.46 X 24 X 30 = **$331 USD.**



For ve2 nodes, pricing is based on both number and type (mega, large, standard, small) of ESXi nodes that are being protected.

Pricing is only for protecting VMware Engine—whole VM backups. It does not include backup management charges for any agent-based backups, such as charges for application consistent backups for SAP HANA, SQL Server, MySQL, Postgres, File System agents, etc. To estimate charges for agent-based backups, refer to [Usage measurement for agent-based backup](https://docs.cloud.google.com/backup-disaster-recovery/pricing#usage-measurement-for-agent-based-backup).

_For VMware Engine ve1 and ve2 storage-only node_

The pricing for protecting a VMware Engine ve1/ve2 storage-only node is determined by the number of VMware Engine ve1/ve2 storage-only nodes added to a cluster that has at least one or more VMware Engine ve1/ve2 protected nodes.

If you have a cluster with VMware Engine ve1/ve2 protected nodes and you add VMware Engine ve1/ve2 storage-only nodes to the same cluster, all of the storage-only nodes in the cluster will be considered protected by default and you will be charged for protecting all of them. You cannot exclude protection for VMware Engine ve1/ve2 storage-only nodes in a cluster that has at least one or more VMware Engine ve1/ve2 protected nodes.

For example, consider you have an existing cluster of 20 nodes and you are protecting 10 of them using Backup and DR Service. If you add 3 storage-only nodes to the cluster, then all 3 storage-only nodes will be considered protected, and you will be charged for protecting 10 + 3 = 13 VMware Engine ve1 nodes.

If you are not protecting any VMware Engine ve1/ve2 nodes on a cluster, VMware Engine v1/ve2 storage-only nodes cannot be protected in that case.

## 

Usage measurement for agent-based backup

Backup and DR measures usage for agent-based backup on the actual size of the workload. For example, if an SQL server database backup uses Backup and DR agent and if the sum of data files from an SQL server is five TiB on a seven TiB volume, the usage is measured as five TiB.

**Usage measurement for agent-based backup of databases**

For Oracle and SQL Server workloads, only the databases protected are counted towards usage. It does not take log files into consideration:

  * **Oracle.** The allocated size of the database files under protection is counted towards usage. The allocated size includes data files and control files.
  * **Microsoft SQL Server.** The total size of all the database files, including .MDF, .LDF, and .NDF files under protection are counted towards usage.
  * **Database protection with Linux Change Block Tracking (CBT).** Backup and DR supports efficient backup of several databases with change block tracking. This backup mode relies on database log and data files to reside on Linux Logical Volume Manager (LVM) managed volumes. For this class of workloads, the usage is measured as the actual used size of the database under protection, using the following queries:
  * **Db2** : call get_dbsize_info(?,?,?,-1);
  * **MariaDB** : SELECT SUM(data_length + index_length) FROM information_schema.TABLES where table_schema='';
  * **MySQL** : SELECT SUM(data_length + index_length) FROM information_schema.TABLES where table_schema='';
  * **PostgreSQL** : SELECT pg_database_size('$db');
  * **SAP ASE** : sp_spaceused;
  * **SAP IQ** : sp_iqdbsize * block_size;
  * **SAP HANA** : select sum(TOTAL_SIZE) from sys_databases.M_VOLUME_FILES where file_type='DATA'
  * **SAP MaxDB** : dbmcli -d $DBSID $MAXDB_KEY info DATA
  * **SQL dump-based protection without Linux CBT.** Backup and DR supports traditional SQL dump based backups. In this mode, usage is measured as the size of the database as reported by the database at the time of backup.



**Factors that influence usage measurement**

Factors that influence usage measurement in out-of-band scenarios:

  * **Compressed volumes.** When volume is compression enabled, the usage counts the post-compression values. For example, if a two TiB volume has 2.5 TiB of data that is compressed into 1.8 TiB, usage count will be 1.8 TiB, not 2.5 TiB.
  * **Windows optimized volumes.** For Windows optimized volumes, Backup and DR rehydrates the volume for backup, and the usage count will be the rehydrated value. For example, if a one TiB Windows optimized volume contains 800GiB data, when rehydrated for backup ends up as 1.1 TiB, the usage is 1.1 TiB.
  * **Block sizes.** For staging disks, Backup and DR measures usage based on the block size of the staging disk. If the source volume's block size and the staging disk block size match, then the usage values will exactly match the source volume. If the block size used on the staging disk is different from the source volume, then there will be a minor difference because the usage calculation is done on the staging disk.
  * **Consistency groups.** The usage count for a consistency group is the sum of all workload sizes in the consistency group. Workloads are measured individually and summed.



**Usage measurement for virtual copies**

Backup and DR measures usage for virtual copies starting when a virtual copy of a workload is created. The amount of usage is based on the size of the application at the time of last backup. As new backups are performed, the amount of usage is updated to reflect the current application size. The most common way to create virtual copies is with mount jobs. There are other job types such as prep-mount and reprovision that can also create a virtual copy. Usage charges are prorated based on the time the virtual copy is in use (from the time of the successful mount to the time of its unmounting, measured in 1-hour increments).

Consider the example of an SQL server database of size 500 GiB. Backups of this database incurs a backup usage charge associated with 500GiB. Additionally, consider a virtual copy of this database is provisioned to a test server at noon on the first of the month from the most recent backup. On the 10th of the month the source database shrinks to 400GiB. On the 20th of the month, the virtual copy is unmounted from the test server at 11 AM. In this scenario, a virtual copy usage charge of 500 GiB is incurred for 12 hours on the 1st, and 24 hours a day every day from 2nd to the time of the backup on the 10th. The virtual copy usage charge changes to 400GiB on the 10th (at the time of the backup) and continues until the 20th of the month. The virtual copy usage for the 20th will only count usage for 11 hours and not for the entire day. The usage amount does not change with additional data written to the virtual copy.

## 

Inter-region data transfer charge

If data is transferred from a backup vault when the source and destination are in different Google Cloud locations, inter-region (cross-region) data transfer charges may apply.

Inter-region data transfer charges apply for the transfers associated with VMware Engine VMs, Oracle databases, SQL Server databases, Compute Engine disks, Compute Engine VMs, Cloud SQL, AlloyDB & Filestore instances. 

Inter-region data transfer charges for all the supported workloads will be billed to the project where the backup vault is located (target project), using the Backup and DR SKUs listed below. The inter-region data transfer charges will be applied for the size of the data being transferred.

Usage-based inter-region data transfer pricing is shown in the table below and is metered per GiB of data transferred.

| North America| Europe| Asia| Indonesia| Oceania| Middle East| Latin America| Africa  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
**North America**|  $0.02| $0.05| $0.08| $0.10| $0.10| $0.11| $0.14| $0.11

What happens if the Backup and DR Service API is disabled?

**API disablement in the project containing a backup vault**

When the Backup and DR Service API is disabled in a project containing a backup vault, the billing behavior will be as follows:

  * Storage billing will continue until backups expire according to the user-defined expiration schedule.
  * For Compute Engine VMs protected into backup vaults
  * Management billing for active protection will continue to be billed (to the project where the protected resource is located) for 30 days. After 30 consecutive days in the disabled state, the protection for the stored resources will be considered inactive.
  * In cases where backup data exists in a backup vault, but the associated resource is no longer under active protection, [management billing for resources no longer under active protection](https://docs.cloud.google.com/backup-disaster-recovery/pricing#resources-not-under-active-protection-but-with-backups-in-a-backup-vault) will apply.
