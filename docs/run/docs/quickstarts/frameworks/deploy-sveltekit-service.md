# Quickstart: Build and deploy a SvelteKit web app to Cloud Run

Learn how to use a single command to build and deploy a "Hello World" web application from a code sample to Google Cloud using Cloud Run.

By following the steps in this quickstart, Cloud Run automatically builds a Dockerfile for you when you [deploy from source code](https://docs.cloud.google.com/run/docs/deploying-source-code).

## Before you begin

  1. Sign in to your Google Cloud account. If you're new to Google Cloud, [ create an account](https://console.cloud.google.com/freetrial) to evaluate how our products perform in real-world scenarios. New customers also get $300 in free credits to run, test, and deploy workloads. 
  2. [Install](https://docs.cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/install) the Google Cloud CLI. 

**Note:** If you installed the gcloud CLI previously, make sure you have the latest version by running `gcloud components update`. 
  3. If you're using an external identity provider (IdP), you must first [ sign in to the gcloud CLI with your federated identity](https://docs.cloud.google.com/iam/docs/workforce-log-in-gcloud). 

  4. To [initialize](https://docs.cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/initializing) the gcloud CLI, run the following command: 
         
         gcloud init

  5. [Create or select a Google Cloud project](https://cloud.google.com/resource-manager/docs/creating-managing-projects).

**Roles required to select or create a project**

     * **Select a project** : Selecting a project doesn't require a specific IAM role—you can select any project that you've been granted a role on. 
     * **Create a project** : To create a project, you need the Project Creator role (`roles/resourcemanager.projectCreator`), which contains the `resourcemanager.projects.create` permission. [Learn how to grant roles](https://docs.cloud.google.com/iam/docs/granting-changing-revoking-access). 
**Note** : If you don't plan to keep the resources that you create in this procedure, create a project instead of selecting an existing project. After you finish these steps, you can delete the project, removing all resources associated with the project.
     * Create a Google Cloud project:
           
           gcloud projects create PROJECT_ID

Replace `PROJECT_ID` with a name for the Google Cloud project you are creating.

     * Select the Google Cloud project that you created:
           
           gcloud config set project PROJECT_ID

Replace `PROJECT_ID` with your Google Cloud project name.

  6. If you're using an existing project for this guide, verify that you have the permissions required to complete this guide. If you created a new project, then you already have the required permissions. 

  7. [Verify that billing is enabled for your Google Cloud project](https://docs.cloud.google.com/billing/docs/how-to/verify-billing-enabled#confirm_billing_is_enabled_on_a_project). 

  8. [Install](https://docs.cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/install) the Google Cloud CLI. 

**Note:** If you installed the gcloud CLI previously, make sure you have the latest version by running `gcloud components update`. 
  9. If you're using an external identity provider (IdP), you must first [ sign in to the gcloud CLI with your federated identity](https://docs.cloud.google.com/iam/docs/workforce-log-in-gcloud). 

  10. To [initialize](https://docs.cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/initializing) the gcloud CLI, run the following command: 
         
         gcloud init

  11. [Create or select a Google Cloud project](https://cloud.google.com/resource-manager/docs/creating-managing-projects).

**Roles required to select or create a project**

     * **Select a project** : Selecting a project doesn't require a specific IAM role—you can select any project that you've been granted a role on. 
     * **Create a project** : To create a project, you need the Project Creator role (`roles/resourcemanager.projectCreator`), which contains the `resourcemanager.projects.create` permission. [Learn how to grant roles](https://docs.cloud.google.com/iam/docs/granting-changing-revoking-access). 
**Note** : If you don't plan to keep the resources that you create in this procedure, create a project instead of selecting an existing project. After you finish these steps, you can delete the project, removing all resources associated with the project.
     * Create a Google Cloud project:
           
           gcloud projects create PROJECT_ID

Replace `PROJECT_ID` with a name for the Google Cloud project you are creating.

     * Select the Google Cloud project that you created:
           
           gcloud config set project PROJECT_ID

Replace `PROJECT_ID` with your Google Cloud project name.

  12. If you're using an existing project for this guide, verify that you have the permissions required to complete this guide. If you created a new project, then you already have the required permissions. 

  13. [Verify that billing is enabled for your Google Cloud project](https://docs.cloud.google.com/billing/docs/how-to/verify-billing-enabled#confirm_billing_is_enabled_on_a_project). 

  14. To set the default project for your Cloud Run service: 
         
         gcloud config set project PROJECT_ID

Replace PROJECT_ID with the name of the project you created for this quickstart. 

  15. If you don't have Node.js 20 or greater installed, [install Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download). 

  16. If you are under a domain restriction organization policy [restricting](https://docs.cloud.google.com/resource-manager/docs/organization-policy/restricting-domains) unauthenticated invocations for your project, you will need to access your deployed service as described under [Testing private services](https://docs.cloud.google.com/run/docs/triggering/https-request#testing-private).

  17. Enable the Cloud Run Admin API and Cloud Build APIs, if any are not already enabled: 

**Roles required to enable APIs**

To enable APIs, you need the `serviceusage.services.enable` permission. If you created the project, then you likely already have this permission through the Owner role (`roles/owner`). Otherwise, you can get this permission through the Service Usage Admin role (`roles/serviceusage.serviceUsageAdmin`). [Learn how to grant roles](https://docs.cloud.google.com/iam/docs/granting-changing-revoking-access). 
         
         gcloud services enable run.googleapis.com cloudbuild.googleapis.com

After the Cloud Run Admin API is enabled, the Compute Engine default service account is automatically created.

  18. Review [Cloud Run pricing](https://cloud.google.com/run/pricing) or estimate costs with the [pricing calculator](https://cloud.google.com/products/calculator).



### Required roles

To get the permissions that you need to complete this quickstart, ask your administrator to grant you the following IAM roles: 

  * [Cloud Run Admin ](https://docs.cloud.google.com/iam/docs/roles-permissions/run#run.admin) (`roles/run.admin`) on the project
  * [Cloud Run Source Developer ](https://docs.cloud.google.com/iam/docs/roles-permissions/run#run.sourceDeveloper) (`roles/run.sourceDeveloper`) on the project
  * [Service Account User ](https://docs.cloud.google.com/iam/docs/roles-permissions/iam#iam.serviceAccountUser) (`roles/iam.serviceAccountUser`) on the service identity
  * [Logs Viewer ](https://docs.cloud.google.com/iam/docs/roles-permissions/logging#logging.viewer) (`roles/logging.viewer`) on the project



For more information about granting roles, see [Manage access to projects, folders, and organizations](https://docs.cloud.google.com/iam/docs/granting-changing-revoking-access). 

You might also be able to get the required permissions through [custom roles](https://docs.cloud.google.com/iam/docs/creating-custom-roles) or other [predefined roles](https://docs.cloud.google.com/iam/docs/roles-overview#predefined). 

### Grant the Cloud Build service account access to your project

Cloud Build automatically uses the [Compute Engine default service account](https://docs.cloud.google.com/build/docs/cloud-build-service-account) as the default Cloud Build service account to build your source code and Cloud Run resource, unless you override this behavior.

For Cloud Build to build your sources, grant the Cloud Build service account the [Cloud Run Builder](https://docs.cloud.google.com/iam/docs/roles-permissions/run#run.builder) (`roles/run.builder`) role on your project:
    
    
    gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding PROJECT_ID \
        --member=serviceAccount:SERVICE_ACCOUNT_EMAIL_ADDRESS \
        --role=roles/run.builder

Replace `PROJECT_ID` with your Google Cloud project ID and `SERVICE_ACCOUNT_EMAIL_ADDRESS` with the email address of the Cloud Build service account. If you're using the Compute Engine default service account as the Cloud Build service account, then use the following format for the service account email address:
    
    
    PROJECT_NUMBER-compute@developer.gserviceaccount.com

Replace `PROJECT_NUMBER` with your Google Cloud project number.

For detailed instructions on how to find your project ID, and project number, see [Creating and managing projects](https://docs.cloud.google.com/resource-manager/docs/creating-managing-projects#identifying_projects).

Granting the Cloud Run builder role takes a couple of minutes to [propagate](https://docs.cloud.google.com/iam/docs/access-change-propagation).

## Write the sample service

You can deploy an existing SvelteKit app to Cloud Run. To create and deploy a new SvelteKit service, follow these steps:

  1. To create a new SvelteKit project named `helloworld`, use the command:
         
         npx -y sv@0 create helloworld
         

Press `Enter` when prompted to accept the defaults.

  2. Change directory into `helloworld`:
         
         cd helloworld
         




Your app is finished and ready to be deployed.

## Deploy to Cloud Run from source

Deploy from source automatically builds a container image from source code and deploys it.

To deploy from source:

  1. In your source code directory, deploy the current folder using the following command:
         
         gcloud run deploy --source .

     1. When you are prompted for the service name, press Enter to accept the default name, for example `helloworld`.

     2. If you are prompted to enable additional APIs on the project, for example, the Artifact Registry API, respond by pressing `y`.

     3. When you are prompted for region: select the region of your choice, for example `europe-west1`.

     4. If you are prompted to create a repository in the specified region, respond by pressing `y`.

     5. If you are prompted to _allow public access_ : respond `y`. You might not see this prompt if there is a domain restriction organization policy that prevents it; for more details see the Before you begin section.

Then wait a few moments until the deployment is complete. On success, the command line displays the service URL.

  2. Visit your deployed service by opening the service URL in a web browser.


**Success:** You deployed a SvelteKit web app to Cloud Run.

### Cloud Run locations

Cloud Run is regional, which means the infrastructure that runs your Cloud Run services is located in a specific region and is managed by Google to be redundantly available across [all the zones within that region](https://docs.cloud.google.com/docs/geography-and-regions).   
  


Meeting your latency, availability, or durability requirements are primary factors for selecting the region where your Cloud Run services are run. You can generally select the region nearest to your users but you should consider the location of the [other Google Cloud products](https://cloud.google.com/about/locations/#locations) that are used by your Cloud Run service. Using Google Cloud products together across multiple locations can affect your service's latency as well as cost.

OK

## Clean up

To avoid additional charges to your Google Cloud account, delete all the resources you deployed with this quickstart.

### Delete your repository

Cloud Run doesn't charge you when your deployed service isn't in use. However, you might still be [charged for storing the container image in Artifact Registry](https://cloud.google.com/artifact-registry/pricing). To delete Artifact Registry repositories, follow the steps in [Delete repositories](https://docs.cloud.google.com/artifact-registry/docs/manage-repos#delete) in the Artifact Registry documentation.

### Delete your service

Cloud Run services don't incur costs until they receive requests. To delete your Cloud Run service, follow one of these steps:

### Console

To delete a service:

  1. In the Google Cloud console, go to the Cloud Run **Services** page:

[Go to Cloud Run](https://console.cloud.google.com/run/services)

  2. Locate the service you want to delete in the services list, and click its checkbox to select it.

  3. Click **Delete**. This deletes all revisions of the service.




###  gcloud 

To delete a service, run the following command:
    
    
    gcloud run services delete SERVICE --region REGION

Replace the following:

  * SERVICE: name of your service.
  * REGION: Google Cloud region of the service.



### Delete your test project

Deleting your Google Cloud project stops billing for all resources in that project. To release all Google Cloud resources in your project, follow these steps:

**Caution** : Deleting a project has the following effects: 
     * **Everything in the project is deleted.** If you used an existing project for the tasks in this document, when you delete it, you also delete any other work you've done in the project. 
     * **Custom project IDs are lost.** When you created this project, you might have created a custom project ID that you want to use in the future. To preserve the URLs that use the project ID, such as an `appspot.com` URL, delete selected resources inside the project instead of deleting the whole project. 

Delete a Google Cloud project:
    
    gcloud projects delete PROJECT_ID
