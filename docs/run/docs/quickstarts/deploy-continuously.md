# Quickstart: Deploy to Cloud Run from a Git repository

This page shows you how to continuously deploy from a Git repository to Cloud Run using Cloud Build.

You can continuously deploy from a repository using [Cloud Build](https://docs.cloud.google.com/run/docs/continuous-deployment#set-up-with-cloud-build) or [Developer Connect](https://docs.cloud.google.com/run/docs/continuous-deployment#set-up-with-developer-connect).

* * *

To follow step-by-step guidance for this task directly in the Google Cloud console, click **Guide me** : 

[Guide me](https://console.cloud.google.com//?tutorial=run--quickstart-github-repo)

* * *

## Before you begin

  1. Sign in to your Google Cloud account. If you're new to Google Cloud, [ create an account](https://console.cloud.google.com/freetrial) to evaluate how our products perform in real-world scenarios. New customers also get $300 in free credits to run, test, and deploy workloads. 
  2. In the Google Cloud console, on the project selector page, select or create a Google Cloud project.

**Roles required to select or create a project**

     * **Select a project** : Selecting a project doesn't require a specific IAM role—you can select any project that you've been granted a role on. 
     * **Create a project** : To create a project, you need the Project Creator role (`roles/resourcemanager.projectCreator`), which contains the `resourcemanager.projects.create` permission. [Learn how to grant roles](https://docs.cloud.google.com/iam/docs/granting-changing-revoking-access). 
**Note** : If you don't plan to keep the resources that you create in this procedure, create a project instead of selecting an existing project. After you finish these steps, you can delete the project, removing all resources associated with the project.

[Go to project selector](https://console.cloud.google.com/projectselector2/home/dashboard)

  3. If you're using an existing project for this guide, verify that you have the permissions required to complete this guide. If you created a new project, then you already have the required permissions. 

  4. [Verify that billing is enabled for your Google Cloud project](https://docs.cloud.google.com/billing/docs/how-to/verify-billing-enabled#confirm_billing_is_enabled_on_a_project). 

  5. In the Google Cloud console, on the project selector page, select or create a Google Cloud project.

**Roles required to select or create a project**

     * **Select a project** : Selecting a project doesn't require a specific IAM role—you can select any project that you've been granted a role on. 
     * **Create a project** : To create a project, you need the Project Creator role (`roles/resourcemanager.projectCreator`), which contains the `resourcemanager.projects.create` permission. [Learn how to grant roles](https://docs.cloud.google.com/iam/docs/granting-changing-revoking-access). 
**Note** : If you don't plan to keep the resources that you create in this procedure, create a project instead of selecting an existing project. After you finish these steps, you can delete the project, removing all resources associated with the project.

[Go to project selector](https://console.cloud.google.com/projectselector2/home/dashboard)

  6. If you're using an existing project for this guide, verify that you have the permissions required to complete this guide. If you created a new project, then you already have the required permissions. 

  7. [Verify that billing is enabled for your Google Cloud project](https://docs.cloud.google.com/billing/docs/how-to/verify-billing-enabled#confirm_billing_is_enabled_on_a_project). 

  8. Enable the Cloud Build API, if it is not already enabled. 

**Roles required to enable APIs**

To enable APIs, you need the `serviceusage.services.enable` permission. If you created the project, then you likely already have this permission through the Owner role (`roles/owner`). Otherwise, you can get this permission through the Service Usage Admin role (`roles/serviceusage.serviceUsageAdmin`). [Learn how to grant roles](https://docs.cloud.google.com/iam/docs/granting-changing-revoking-access). 

[Enable the API](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/enableflow?apiid=cloudbuild.googleapis.com)

  9. If you are under a domain restriction organization policy [restricting](https://docs.cloud.google.com/resource-manager/docs/organization-policy/restricting-domains) unauthenticated invocations for your project, you will need to access your deployed service as described under [Testing private services](https://docs.cloud.google.com/run/docs/triggering/https-request#testing-private).

  10. Review [Cloud Run pricing](https://cloud.google.com/run/pricing) or estimate costs with the [pricing calculator](https://cloud.google.com/products/calculator).



### Required roles

To get the permissions that you need to complete this quickstart, ask your administrator to grant you the following IAM roles: 

  * [Cloud Run Source Developer ](https://docs.cloud.google.com/iam/docs/roles-permissions/run#run.sourceDeveloper) (`roles/run.sourceDeveloper`) on the service
  * [Cloud Run Admin ](https://docs.cloud.google.com/iam/docs/roles-permissions/run#run.admin) (`roles/run.admin`) on the project
  * [Service Account User ](https://docs.cloud.google.com/iam/docs/roles-permissions/iam#iam.serviceAccountUser) (`roles/iam.serviceAccountUser`) on the service identity
  * [Logs Viewer ](https://docs.cloud.google.com/iam/docs/roles-permissions/logging#logging.viewer) (`roles/logging.viewer`) on the project



For more information about granting roles, see [Manage access to projects, folders, and organizations](https://docs.cloud.google.com/iam/docs/granting-changing-revoking-access). 

You might also be able to get the required permissions through [custom roles](https://docs.cloud.google.com/iam/docs/creating-custom-roles) or other [predefined roles](https://docs.cloud.google.com/iam/docs/roles-overview#predefined). 

## Create a repository from template

To create a repository:

  1. Go to the template repository:

###  Node.js 

Go to [github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/cloud-run-microservice-template-nodejs](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/cloud-run-microservice-template-nodejs)

###  Python 

Go to [github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/cloud-run-microservice-template-python](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/cloud-run-microservice-template-python)

###  Go 

Go to [github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/cloud-run-microservice-template-go](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/cloud-run-microservice-template-go)

###  Java 

Go to [github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/cloud-run-microservice-template-java](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/cloud-run-microservice-template-java)

  2. Click **Use this template**.

  3. Select **Create a new repository**.

  4. In the form, enter a **repository name**.

  5. Click **Create repository**.




## Deploy from the repository

To deploy from the repository:

  1. In the Google Cloud console, go to the Cloud Run page:

[Go to Cloud Run](https://console.cloud.google.com/run?enableapi=true)

  2. Select **Services** from the menu, and click **Connect repo**.

  3. In the form, select **Cloud Build** , and click **Set up with Cloud Build**.

  4. In the right panel:

     1. Under **Repository** , select the newly created repository. If you haven't already authenticated, you might be required to do so. Use the **authenticate** link under the **Repository Provider** field.

     2. Check the confirmation agreement about GitHub and Google Cloud interactivity.

     3. Click **Next**.

     4. Under **Build Type** , select **Google Cloud Buildpacks**.

     5. Click **Save**.

  5. In the **Create service** form:

     1. Confirm the name of the service. It will be automatically populated with the repository name.

     2. In the **Region** pulldown menu, select the region where you want your service located.

     3. Under **Authentication** , select **Allow public access**. If you don't have permissions (Cloud Run Admin role) to select this, the service will deploy and require authentication.

     4. Click **Create** to deploy the sample repository to Cloud Run and wait for the deployment to finish.

  6. Click the displayed URL link to run the deployed container.




### Cloud Run locations

Cloud Run is regional, which means the infrastructure that runs your Cloud Run services is located in a specific region and is managed by Google to be redundantly available across [all the zones within that region](https://docs.cloud.google.com/docs/geography-and-regions).   
  


Meeting your latency, availability, or durability requirements are primary factors for selecting the region where your Cloud Run services are run. You can generally select the region nearest to your users but you should consider the location of the [other Google Cloud products](https://cloud.google.com/about/locations/#locations) that are used by your Cloud Run service. Using Google Cloud products together across multiple locations can affect your service's latency as well as cost.  
  


Cloud Run is available in the following regions:

If you already created a Cloud Run service, you can view the region in the Cloud Run dashboard in the [Google Cloud console](https://console.cloud.google.com/run).

OK

## Update the service

To make changes to the service:

  1. Push a commit to the main branch of the repository.

  2. Refresh the Cloud Run service to see the status of the update.


**Success:** You deployed a container image from a Git repository to Cloud Run.

Cloud Run automatically scales your container instances based on demand, and you only pay for the CPU, memory, and networking consumed during request processing.

## Clean up

To avoid additional charges to your Google Cloud account, delete all the resources you deployed with this quickstart.

### Delete your repository

Cloud Run doesn't charge you when your deployed service isn't in use. However, you might still be [charged for storing the container image in Artifact Registry](https://cloud.google.com/artifact-registry/pricing). To delete Artifact Registry repositories, follow the steps in [Delete repositories](https://docs.cloud.google.com/artifact-registry/docs/manage-repos#delete) in the Artifact Registry documentation.

### Delete your service

Cloud Run services don't incur costs until they receive requests. To delete your Cloud Run service, follow one of these steps:

### Console

To delete a service:

  1. In the Google Cloud console, go to the Cloud Run **Services** page:

[Go to Cloud Run](https://console.cloud.google.com/run/services)

  2. Locate the service you want to delete in the services list, and click its checkbox to select it.

  3. Click **Delete**. This deletes all revisions of the service.




###  gcloud 

To delete a service, run the following command:
    
    
    gcloud run services delete SERVICE --region REGION

Replace the following:

  * SERVICE: name of your service.
  * REGION: Google Cloud region of the service.



### Delete your test project

Deleting your Google Cloud project stops billing for all resources in that project. To release all Google Cloud resources in your project, follow these steps:

**Caution** : Deleting a project has the following effects: 
     * **Everything in the project is deleted.** If you used an existing project for the tasks in this document, when you delete it, you also delete any other work you've done in the project. 
     * **Custom project IDs are lost.** When you created this project, you might have created a custom project ID that you want to use in the future. To preserve the URLs that use the project ID, such as an `appspot.com` URL, delete selected resources inside the project instead of deleting the whole project. 
  1. In the Google Cloud console, go to the **Manage resources** page. 

[Go to Manage resources](https://console.cloud.google.com/iam-admin/projects)

  2. In the project list, select the project that you want to delete, and then click **Delete**. 
  3. In the dialog, type the project ID, and then click **Shut down** to delete the project.
