Reference documentation and code samples for the Data Analytics API with Gemini V1BETA API class Google::Cloud::GeminiDataAnalytics::V1beta::ErrorMessage.

An error message from a tool call. This message is used to represent an error that occurred while an agent was trying to use a tool. It's important to note that not all errors are terminal. Many are recoverable, and the agent may use the information from this error message to self-correct and retry the tool call or try a different approach.

For example, if a data query fails, the agent might receive an `ErrorMessage`, analyze it, and then generate a corrected query.

Clients should be cautious about interpreting this message as a definitive failure. It can be part of the agent's normal, iterative process of completing a task. Surfacing these errors directly to end-users without context (e.g., as a "hard failure") may be misleading.
