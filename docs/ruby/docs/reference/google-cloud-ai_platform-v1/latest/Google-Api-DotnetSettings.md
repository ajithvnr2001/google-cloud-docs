## Includes

  * Google::Protobuf::MessageExts 



## Methods 

### #common
    
    
    def common() -> ::Google::Api::CommonLanguageSettings

**Returns**

  * ([::Google::Api::CommonLanguageSettings](https://docs.cloud.google.com/ruby/docs/reference/google-cloud-ai_platform-v1/latest/Google-Api-CommonLanguageSettings)) — Some settings. 



### #common=
    
    
    def common=(value) -> ::Google::Api::CommonLanguageSettings

**Parameter**

  * **value** ([::Google::Api::CommonLanguageSettings](https://docs.cloud.google.com/ruby/docs/reference/google-cloud-ai_platform-v1/latest/Google-Api-CommonLanguageSettings)) — Some settings. 



**Returns**

  * ([::Google::Api::CommonLanguageSettings](https://docs.cloud.google.com/ruby/docs/reference/google-cloud-ai_platform-v1/latest/Google-Api-CommonLanguageSettings)) — Some settings. 



### #forced_namespace_aliases
    
    
    def forced_namespace_aliases() -> ::Array<::String>

**Returns**

  * (::Array<::String>) — Namespaces which must be aliased in snippets due to a known (but non-generator-predictable) naming collision 



### #forced_namespace_aliases=
    
    
    def forced_namespace_aliases=(value) -> ::Array<::String>

**Parameter**

  * **value** (::Array<::String>) — Namespaces which must be aliased in snippets due to a known (but non-generator-predictable) naming collision 



**Returns**

  * (::Array<::String>) — Namespaces which must be aliased in snippets due to a known (but non-generator-predictable) naming collision 



### #handwritten_signatures
    
    
    def handwritten_signatures() -> ::Array<::String>

**Returns**

  * (::Array<::String>) — Method signatures (in the form "service.method(signature)") which are provided separately, so shouldn't be generated. Snippets _calling_ these methods are still generated, however. 



### #handwritten_signatures=
    
    
    def handwritten_signatures=(value) -> ::Array<::String>

**Parameter**

  * **value** (::Array<::String>) — Method signatures (in the form "service.method(signature)") which are provided separately, so shouldn't be generated. Snippets _calling_ these methods are still generated, however. 



**Returns**

  * (::Array<::String>) — Method signatures (in the form "service.method(signature)") which are provided separately, so shouldn't be generated. Snippets _calling_ these methods are still generated, however. 



### #ignored_resources
    
    
    def ignored_resources() -> ::Array<::String>

**Returns**

  * (::Array<::String>) — List of full resource types to ignore during generation. This is typically used for API-specific Location resources, which should be handled by the generator as if they were actually the common Location resources. Example entry: "documentai.googleapis.com/Location" 



### #ignored_resources=
    
    
    def ignored_resources=(value) -> ::Array<::String>

**Parameter**

  * **value** (::Array<::String>) — List of full resource types to ignore during generation. This is typically used for API-specific Location resources, which should be handled by the generator as if they were actually the common Location resources. Example entry: "documentai.googleapis.com/Location" 



**Returns**

  * (::Array<::String>) — List of full resource types to ignore during generation. This is typically used for API-specific Location resources, which should be handled by the generator as if they were actually the common Location resources. Example entry: "documentai.googleapis.com/Location" 



### #renamed_resources
    
    
    def renamed_resources() -> ::Google::Protobuf::Map{::String => ::String}

**Returns**

  * (::Google::Protobuf::Map{::String => ::String}) — Map from full resource types to the effective short name for the resource. This is used when otherwise resource named from different services would cause naming collisions. Example entry: "datalabeling.googleapis.com/Dataset": "DataLabelingDataset" 



### #renamed_resources=
    
    
    def renamed_resources=(value) -> ::Google::Protobuf::Map{::String => ::String}

**Parameter**

  * **value** (::Google::Protobuf::Map{::String => ::String}) — Map from full resource types to the effective short name for the resource. This is used when otherwise resource named from different services would cause naming collisions. Example entry: "datalabeling.googleapis.com/Dataset": "DataLabelingDataset" 



**Returns**

  * (::Google::Protobuf::Map{::String => ::String}) — Map from full resource types to the effective short name for the resource. This is used when otherwise resource named from different services would cause naming collisions. Example entry: "datalabeling.googleapis.com/Dataset": "DataLabelingDataset" 



### #renamed_services
    
    
    def renamed_services() -> ::Google::Protobuf::Map{::String => ::String}

**Returns**

  * (::Google::Protobuf::Map{::String => ::String}) — Map from original service names to renamed versions. This is used when the default generated types would cause a naming conflict. (Neither name is fully-qualified.) Example: Subscriber to SubscriberServiceApi. 



### #renamed_services=
    
    
    def renamed_services=(value) -> ::Google::Protobuf::Map{::String => ::String}

**Parameter**

  * **value** (::Google::Protobuf::Map{::String => ::String}) — Map from original service names to renamed versions. This is used when the default generated types would cause a naming conflict. (Neither name is fully-qualified.) Example: Subscriber to SubscriberServiceApi. 



**Returns**

  * (::Google::Protobuf::Map{::String => ::String}) — Map from original service names to renamed versions. This is used when the default generated types would cause a naming conflict. (Neither name is fully-qualified.) Example: Subscriber to SubscriberServiceApi.
