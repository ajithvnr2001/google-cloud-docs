Reference documentation and code samples for the Google Cloud Compute V1 API class Google::Cloud::Compute::V1::TargetGrpcProxy.

Represents a Target gRPC Proxy resource.

A target gRPC proxy is a component of load balancers intended for load balancing gRPC traffic. Only global forwarding rules with load balancing scheme INTERNAL_SELF_MANAGED can reference a target gRPC proxy. The target gRPC Proxy references a URL map that specifies how traffic is routed to gRPC backend services.
