## Methods 

### #error
    
    
    def error() -> ::Google::Rpc::Status

**Returns**

  * ([::Google::Rpc::Status](https://docs.cloud.google.com/ruby/docs/reference/google-cloud-bigquery-reservation-v1/latest/Google-Rpc-Status)) — Output only. The last error encountered while trying to replicate changes from the primary to the secondary. This field is only available if the replication has not succeeded since. 



### #last_error_time
    
    
    def last_error_time() -> ::Google::Protobuf::Timestamp

**Returns**

  * ([::Google::Protobuf::Timestamp](https://docs.cloud.google.com/ruby/docs/reference/google-cloud-bigquery-reservation-v1/latest/Google-Protobuf-Timestamp)) — Output only. The time at which the last error was encountered while trying to replicate changes from the primary to the secondary. This field is only available if the replication has not succeeded since. 



### #last_replication_time
    
    
    def last_replication_time() -> ::Google::Protobuf::Timestamp

**Returns**

  * ([::Google::Protobuf::Timestamp](https://docs.cloud.google.com/ruby/docs/reference/google-cloud-bigquery-reservation-v1/latest/Google-Protobuf-Timestamp)) — Output only. A timestamp corresponding to the last change on the primary that was successfully replicated to the secondary. 



### #soft_failover_start_time
    
    
    def soft_failover_start_time() -> ::Google::Protobuf::Timestamp

**Returns**

  * ([::Google::Protobuf::Timestamp](https://docs.cloud.google.com/ruby/docs/reference/google-cloud-bigquery-reservation-v1/latest/Google-Protobuf-Timestamp)) — Output only. The time at which a soft failover for the reservation and its associated datasets was initiated. After this field is set, all subsequent changes to the reservation will be rejected unless a hard failover overrides this operation. This field will be cleared once the failover is complete.
