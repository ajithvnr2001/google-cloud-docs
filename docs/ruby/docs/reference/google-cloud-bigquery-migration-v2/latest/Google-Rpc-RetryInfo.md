Reference documentation and code samples for the BigQuery Migration V2 API class Google::Rpc::RetryInfo.

Describes when the clients can retry a failed request. Clients could ignore the recommendation here or retry when this information is missing from error responses.

It's always recommended that clients should use exponential backoff when retrying.

Clients should wait until `retry_delay` amount of time has passed since receiving the error response before retrying. If retrying requests also fail, clients should use an exponential backoff scheme to gradually increase the delay between retries based on `retry_delay`, until either a maximum number of retries have been reached or a maximum retry delay cap has been reached.
