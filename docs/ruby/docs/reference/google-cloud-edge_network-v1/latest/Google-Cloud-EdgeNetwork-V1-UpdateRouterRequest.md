## Methods 

### #request_id
    
    
    def request_id() -> ::String

**Returns**

  * (::String) — Optional. An optional request ID to identify requests. Specify a unique request ID so that if you must retry your request, the server will know to ignore the request if it has already been completed. The server will guarantee that for at least 60 minutes since the first request.

For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and the request times out. If you make the request again with the same request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments.

The request ID must be a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID is not supported (00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000). 




### #request_id=
    
    
    def request_id=(value) -> ::String

**Parameter**

  * **value** (::String) — Optional. An optional request ID to identify requests. Specify a unique request ID so that if you must retry your request, the server will know to ignore the request if it has already been completed. The server will guarantee that for at least 60 minutes since the first request.

### #router
    
    
    def router() -> ::Google::Cloud::EdgeNetwork::V1::Router

**Returns**

  * ([::Google::Cloud::EdgeNetwork::V1::Router](https://docs.cloud.google.com/ruby/docs/reference/google-cloud-edge_network-v1/latest/Google-Cloud-EdgeNetwork-V1-Router)) — Required. The resource being updated 



### #router=
    
    
    def router=(value) -> ::Google::Cloud::EdgeNetwork::V1::Router

**Parameter**

  * **value** ([::Google::Cloud::EdgeNetwork::V1::Router](https://docs.cloud.google.com/ruby/docs/reference/google-cloud-edge_network-v1/latest/Google-Cloud-EdgeNetwork-V1-Router)) — Required. The resource being updated 



**Returns**

  * ([::Google::Cloud::EdgeNetwork::V1::Router](https://docs.cloud.google.com/ruby/docs/reference/google-cloud-edge_network-v1/latest/Google-Cloud-EdgeNetwork-V1-Router)) — Required. The resource being updated 



### #update_mask
    
    
    def update_mask() -> ::Google::Protobuf::FieldMask

**Returns**

  * ([::Google::Protobuf::FieldMask](https://docs.cloud.google.com/ruby/docs/reference/google-cloud-edge_network-v1/latest/Google-Protobuf-FieldMask)) — Required. Field mask is used to specify the fields to be overwritten in the Router resource by the update. The fields specified in the update_mask are relative to the resource, not the full request. A field will be overwritten if it is in the mask. If the user does not provide a mask then all fields will be overwritten. 



### #update_mask=
    
    
    def update_mask=(value) -> ::Google::Protobuf::FieldMask

**Parameter**

  * **value** ([::Google::Protobuf::FieldMask](https://docs.cloud.google.com/ruby/docs/reference/google-cloud-edge_network-v1/latest/Google-Protobuf-FieldMask)) — Required. Field mask is used to specify the fields to be overwritten in the Router resource by the update. The fields specified in the update_mask are relative to the resource, not the full request. A field will be overwritten if it is in the mask. If the user does not provide a mask then all fields will be overwritten.
